Over the past several years, we've started seeing markets sprout up that all claim to emphasize "sharing" between workers and customers. There have been too many to name, maybe too many to count. You might have worked for one of them, or a few of them. Or a lot of them.

If you're here, my hunch is that you've found that the "sharing economy" hasn't been everything that was promised, and you're looking for something else. So am I.

A little over a year ago I got to work on [Dynamo][dynamo], a platform that allowed Turkers - workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) - to coordinate collective action. For all we managed to do (including a [very public letter-writing campaign to Jeff Bezos][letters], covered [here][guardian] and [here][verge]), I personally felt like we were working to make a bad situation less bad. And it wasn't just on AMT; workers on lots of platforms have expressed frustration with the ways they've been handled (and mishandled). Frustration with the way these platforms were designed.

A lot of these markets seem to operate on an implied premise that workers need to be managed, reduced to replaceable cogs in a larger machine, and disempowered for those markets to work.

**I can't accept that premise.**

I wanted to build a labor market that cared about workers from the start. I spent months reading and working on this, and ultimately decided that something like a worker cooperative - where **workers** own the business - might be the best approach. It would make it possible for workers to figure out what's fair (and avoid doing what's not) in this new style of work.

So I spent last summer interning at Microsoft Research, working with labor unions and worker advocacy groups, studying gig work and coming up with designs for a more worker-centric labor market. Some of the people I studied told me that, without face-to-face meeting, it'd be impossible to build the trust and shared sense of investment needed to run a system like this.

It might be (very) hard, but I think it's worth making every effort to prove that worker-owned gig labor markets can succeed. More than that, I think we need to find a way to make this work or gig work will continue to be a harmful place for workers.

I can offer a few things to help: A background in Anthropology, studying digital cultures and spending months learning to be patient while doing fieldwork. I won't be perfect, but I also won't give up. I can also offer some technical skills and a bunch of research in building successful online communities. I can help scaffold a system that makes it easier for people to trust each other.

My experience says that we need to start with a place for people to talk freely, figure out what they need, what they want, and what they think is fair. That's what this forum is for. Down the road, I'm going to help build a platform for workers to accept work - one much like the mobile applications you may have used for other platforms but built *with* you, *for* you.

We need to figure out a lot of things before workers can start accepting work, but you'll be the ones figuring these things out - not someone else. Hopefully this is exciting. If you're on board, register and post that you're on board with the idea, and that you'll try to steer it in a good direction. And tell us a little about yourself :)
