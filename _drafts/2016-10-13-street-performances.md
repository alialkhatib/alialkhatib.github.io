title: Streaming (and (maybe) Street Performances)

Lately I've been thinking about some of the ways that people make money from or through the internet,
in particular trying to find interesting ways that haven't been covered yet,
and whether there's some aspect of these people's work that's novel and worth researching.
One of the leading interesting topics, to me at least, has been streaming, YouTubing, etc...

A few papers look at Twitch and streaming in general, but
they look at the phenomenon as primarily socially motivated, or
look at streaming as some sort of secondary effect.
Some interesting examples:

- "[Watch me playing, i am a professional: a first study on video game live streaming][watchMe]"
is an interesting paper out of WWW '12
that looks at e--sports through Twitch (a streaming platform).
I want to call this out as not within the boundary that I'm interested in because
the income generation here is from competitive sports
(e--sports like Starcraft II (the focus of their study), League of Legends, etc...).
Still, super interesting, super informative, and definitely in the right realm of study

- "[Streaming on twitch: fostering participatory communities of play within live mixed media][participatoryCommunity]"
might be the most relevant paper to my research interests right now.
The authors of this paper look at the social aspect of streaming on Twitch,
the followers streamers accumulate, the community that forms on this film that encompasses all sorts of games,
and even talks briefly about the revenue model involved in streaming.
It shouldn't be hugely surprising that a paper at CHI ('14) is relevant to my interest
(as that's the kind of conference I would think to write to),
but spends a little too much time talking about
hot and cool media,
low and high fidelity,
and generally getting stuck in what I feel are the weeds.
There's also some talk about motivation, and while
that's interesting and I suspect I would need to know a bit about this before talking to streamers and YouTubers, 
I have a hunch that the motivations of the people that I'm interested in talking to
(again, professionals, rather than enthusiasts) are motivated by some of the same things that 
motivate many performers --- a desire to make a name for oneself, express something, etc.

- "[On crowdsourced interactive live streaming: a Twitch.tv--based measurement study][measurementStudy]"
looks at Twitch and streaming through two lenses that seem to make it not quite what I'm looking to answer.
**First**, it takes a really long, hard look at stuff like the technical architecture of Twitch
--- something that I'm sure is interesting, but way on the other side of the social setting, the politics, etc...
and **second**, it calls out that they're looking at Twitch streamers as "non--professional".
I'm specifically interested in the people that make this
(streaming, YouTube, etc...)
their livelihood or at least a significant part of their professional identity, so
I think this can inform my research, but doesn't satisfy my curiosity.


So overall we're getting a picture first of the technical aspects of things like Twitch
--- the enormous bandwidth necessary to support this kind of platform, etc... ---
and second of the social aspects of streaming,
in particular as a site of participatory community.
There are two things that seem to be missing here.
First, I get the sense that there are people making a life for themselves *by* streaming,
rather than what I would describe as *while* streaming.
That is, people put videos on YouTube as part of a business
--- as a direct means to the end that is as entertainers rather than as (e--)athletes
and the like who happen to promote themselves via YouTube or other platforms.

Second, and this is speaking to my last post (about "[Meta Points][]"), I think
we're seriously lacking some historical framing, some ontological lens on social behavior,
that helps us contextualize and understand what's going on here.
I have a hunch that somewhere buried in the literature about
street performers, busking, and other transient entertainers with a finger on the pulse of the audience
there might be something helpful to explain what's going on here.
I might be totally off the mark, which is why I'm posting
--- in the hope that someone with another take might
[email or tweet at me][contact me] to say
I'm totally wrong and that I should look into something else.

This is one post in my long journey to feel out research topics that I think would be interesting.
Maybe you could say that I'm posting them as an open offer to take this idea and run with it.
I'm not really sure what I plan to do with it, but
if this sparked your interest, let me know.
If you have any suggestions of possibly interesting research topics,
please be sure to [contact me][].
