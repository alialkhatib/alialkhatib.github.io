Something that has been particularly salient to me in the last few months has been how ubiquitous failure, rejection, and self-doubt seems to be in graduate school. Paper submissions, fellowship applications, grant proposals, applications to internships, and the many moments in day to day life that offer you a moment to stop and *really* think about what a fraud you are (kidding (partly)) have this cumulative effect of making you very unsure of yourself. It doesn't help that most people get rejected most of the time, so generally the shots you do take tend to miss. That can be demoralizing, or at least demotivating. Or I think it is; if you have no idea what I'm talking about, either stop reading or contact me *immediately*.

A few types of failure have sort of emerged lately, and I've come up with some ways of dealing with failure that have helped me avoid dropping out of graduate school and (going back to) sweeping docks for a living.
