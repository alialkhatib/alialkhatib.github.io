I'm at CHI this year in San Jose, SV'ing to pay my way through.
99% of the event is running smoothly, and everyone is doing an amazing job.
Nobody would read a post about how hard everyone is working and how well that's going,
so I'm going to focus on the 1%.

The gist is that communication is
(at least generally perceived to be)
a crucial component in effectively managing volunteers.
The "historical" system worked as follows:

- Student volunteers have (very narrowly defined) tasks assigned to them
- if anything goes wrong (**at all**), escalate to the "floor monitor"
- the floor monitor walks around in large circles with a very visible green hat, armed with a walkie talkie
- that walkie talkie relays problems to the central office
- the central office shouts out for a "quick response" volunteer in the room
- the quick response volunteer volunteers to response. quickly.

That sounds complicated, and that might be because it is;
there are several layers impeding communication, for deliberate reasons: the people who manage allocating more resources
(whether we're talking extension cords or human intelligence expertise)
are very bandwidth-limited. They can't handle every random request that comes their way.

This is arguably a problematic setup, but for the purposes of this conference's needs
(a largely ad hoc volunteer organization with virtually no on-site training)
it's probably close enough to optimal that a radical change in the hierarchy would probably do more harm than good.

THe problem isn't actually in this approach.
The problem is that we're trying out Slack, and that's great,
and now nobody wants to use the original practices,
because it makes reporting issues much lower-stress.
We don't need to find someone and report it with urgency over walkie talkie;
we can just fire off a message and trust that someone will deal with it when they can.

Problems arose when we made an #urgent channel, created to allow people to request something urgently.
Let's ignore that they technically should be asking a floor monitor to relay the problem and focus on
the fact that they'
