I'm not really equipped to write about what happened in Charleston last week
(although, like much of 2017, it feels like it's been much longer than that).
But there is an aspect of this that I think I can talk about from a place of
"not total ignorance".
That's the perspective of how tech companies can (or should)
deal with objectionable content on their systems.

This might not be as satisfying a post as you (or anyone) might be hoping for ---
I'm not going to say that Cloudflare should do or say anything specific;
I'm not going to demand that Twitter shut down any accounts specifically or thematically;
I'm not going to argue that YouTube should shut down ISIS or KKK or any organizations.

My argument is this: whatever your stance, own it. Don't be chickenshit about it.

Tech companies have liked to argue that they see themselves as
neutral platforms for anyone to use however they see fit, and argued that
censoring any voice,
no matter how objectionable,
is anathema to the premise of free speech which we hold dear.
In some sense, these sites
(sites like Twitter, Cloudflare, Facebook, YouTube, and others)
like to fashion themselves as some sort of infrastructural feature.
They're just this platform on which people stand;
they're no more involved than the soapbox from which people speak.

_Oh, right. Check out the Library of Congress archive for tons of interesting historical photos_

On one hand I see optimists describe the systems being built
(generally in Silicon Valley, but that's a whole other story)
collectively as a panacea for many of the world's problems.
On the other hand I see many of the same people shy away from
