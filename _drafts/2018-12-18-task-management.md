I'll cut to the chase: I've been trying to figure out a task/reminder management system for some time now, and I might've found it in [OmniFocus][].


I use lots of calendars - 16, at the moment. One of those calendars is called "repeatables", which is pretty much what it sounds like: all the _repeatable_ events in my life. This calendar is a bit of a problem.

Every mundane, tedious chore that I can think to document and that occurs semi-regularly gets thrown in there. I have events for every stupid thing you can imagine: take out the trash (Wednesday nights); replace toothbrush (every 3 months); clean ceiling fan (every 2 months (_it's really annoying_)); work out (every morning); laundry (every Sunday).

The benefit of calendaring chores and self-care like this - at least for me - is essentially a guarantee that I'll never overextend myself and make it impossible to get basic things done that I need to do to be a healthy, _generally_ happy person.

I can illustrate this with an example. I have a calendar event to do *laundry* every Sunday. If I neglect to do my laundry for a few weeks, it's not the end of the world. But at some point I'll run out of clean clothing, and then I'll have to make some mildly uncomfortable decisions about what to do (ie "the sniff test"). Aside from looking (and perhaps smelling) worse, I'll _feel_ worse. That's no good for me, especially since this is so avoidable.

No matter how busy I get, or how far ahead I look, I can reason about how I'll need to move things around to make everything work. If I'm going out of town for a weekend, I might need to do laundry before I leave. That's fine; I just need to find a chunk of time earlier in the week. Some people reschedule meetings by dragging them around - I made all of my everyday chores the same way.

I have a problem (with managing and measuring my productivity).

Over the years I've acquired lots of habits (like distinct calendars for all sorts of categories of events - some examples: *events*, *concerts*, *offline meetings*, *online meetings* (of course), *courses*, *repeatables*).

It's that last calendar - "repeatables" - that I've wanted to do something about for a while.

This calendar is pretty self-explanatory, but the gist is "if it's a thing that repeats, it should go in that calendar". This is especially true if it's private work, but essentially it's a calendar for things that I need to do repeatedly. Laundry (weekly), working out (daily), even replacing my toothbrush (every 3 months).

I know this is bizarre. Hang with me while I try to explain why I'm weird:

All of these little things in my life are chores, but they're **necessary** chores.
If I don't find time to do laundry, I'll run out of clean clothes and have to make some *really* tough decisions for a few days.
I hardly remember when I opened the package for the toothbrush I'm using right now, so odds are I'll forget it's time to replace it for a while, and the
