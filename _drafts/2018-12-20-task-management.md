I don't know if anyone will care about this (I barely do), but I've developed a very peculiar (read: obnoxious, demanding, needy, whatever you want) set of needs for a system that'll help me keep track of tasks I need to get done (everything ranging from trivial to critical). I think I've found the right mix of things to make that work, and sometimes my solutions to problems are useful to other people (e.g. this site turned out to be a helpful starting point for a few people; some people have also adopted certain aspects of the way I write papers). So I decided I'd try and document how I ended up in this weird place, what I'm doing about it now, and why I think this is the end of my search.


## How I ended up in this weird place

Let's start with the annoying stuff first: I put just about everything on a calendar. There was a time that I was individually documenting little bits of things like "get ready and head to the office" and "take medicine" (okay, those are both still things on my calendar).

Having these things on a calendar helps me out on a few dimensions:

1. It helps me guarantee to myself that I'm definitely **making time for self-care** (we can talk more about how weird this is later, but it's a thing I've decided I want to do).
2. It gives me an opportunity to **reschedule** things that I need to do, but didn't get around to doing at the time.
3. Knowing that little stuff (e.g. "order contact lenses") is somewhere in the future on my calendar means I don't need to think about it. At some point I'll get a notification that I need to schedule an appointment with an optometrist and renew my prescription, but for now I can just **not worry about it**.

The second point needs to land a little more concretely before we can move on, so let's work through an example. I have "laundry" as a weekly event on my calendar. I have enough clothing to go longer than that, but history has taught me that any number of things (depression, travel, laziness, etc...) can get in the way of that routine.

By forcing myself to have a check-in where time is at least _reserved_ to do laundry, I ensure that I can catch up if a week slips by and I haven't done it. The only way things will get so "off the rails" that I'm at risk of not having clean clothing is if I blow past several instances, and that has a relatively distinct visual form on my calendar. I can see that I'm slipping behind on _stuff in general_.

That might have been tedious, but I think you'll find it foreshadows things that I need.

If we don't double back now then we'll never talk about the first point, so let's briefly do that. If you're not interested in why I formally give a shit about self-care, that's ... fine, I guess; skip to the horizontal rule element (the long horizontal line) below.

Something grad school does effectively (for me, at least) is insist its own priorities, sometimes asserting them over my own needs. It's easy to lose sight of things that matter for my own well-being, and at some point in the last few years I realized that I needed to be more assertive (and deliberate) about the things that keep me healthy and happy.

It might not seem like **exercise** should take nearly as much priority as meeting with my advisor, and it's true that on any given single instance I'll cancel on exercise if the alternative means losing time with my advisor, but doing so means deliberately deleting or moving that instance of self-care from my calendar. Doing it _a lot_ means repeatedly deleting (or rescheduling) it. It means making a conscious decision, to say nothing of being tedious.

Yes, I played Ocarina of Time when I was a kid, and I _do_ miss [Navi][hey listen!].

## What I'm doing now

Okay so we're all on the same page about this stuff (or you're hate-reading this post, which... is one way to live, I guess), let's talk about the process.

In a nutshell, it's OmniFocus, Fantastical,
