CHI this year was stressful but fortunately really rewarding.

### Some more meta thoughts

There was some graffiti placed on a poster of some of our (mostly corporate) sponsors. Someone posted their [concern][] about this. It led to a conversation. I'm realizing at this point maybe I should say **I didn't do it**, but I resonate with it. There are so many issues that aren't being sufficiently surfaced in the comment thread except by a small handful of people:
- Where were all these people when people with disabilities couldn't use a toilet?
- How corporations feel seems to elicit more response from our community than the wellbeing of of peers, and that makes me kind of nauseous.
- 


I have one last thought: As is the case every year, there's an embarrassing amount unlearned from year to year at CHI. At the town hall meeting, the frustration among people with accessibility issues was apparent. Toilet facilities specifically for people with mobility-related disabilities were locked by default, which isn't something you want to discover when you want to relieve yourself. This definitely happened last year at CSCW and it seems to happen at CHI every year - something gets overlooked.

I have a modest proposal (not involving mulching!), and it's this: **stop bouncing around the world**. It's whimsical and fun and, more seriously, it brings the conference closer to people (at least once in a while) than it would if it was in one place every year over and over again. But it also makes all of the site-specific work that accessibility chairs do almost completely worthless. The general lessons learned and whatnot are all transferable, but what good is it to know the best way to reach the manager of the staff at the SSE Hydro if we'll never host CHI in Glasgow again?

I'm not suggesting that we stick to one location as is the case with SIGGRAPH - I think that would give a permanent "advantage" to a region that would result in local universities sending all of their students every year. But we could rotate among 5 places in the world.

There are 30+ cities in the world that have more than 10 million residents - places like London, New York, Seoul, etc... without serious ethical baggage (rules out the UAE, )



But there are probably a number of locations in the world that can easily accommodate 5,000 people. That's a healthy margin over our current attendance, so it gives us room to grow. Filter down to places with easy transportation to the venue (flights to London were several hundred dollars cheaper for people in my group than flights to Glasgow were - megalopolises have enormous transportation advantages) and . Filter again to prefer against overlap of continents (e.g. prefer to have one venue in Europe, one in Asia, etc...), and I bet we can find 4-5 venues into which we can really invest learning and developing institutional knowledge about
