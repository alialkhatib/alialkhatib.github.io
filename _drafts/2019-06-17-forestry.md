I've been reading about trees and forestry lately, and something about this story James Scott tells in his book _Seeing Like a State_ has me thinking a lot about online advertising (and, more generally, the design of sociotechnical systems).

At the turn of the 18th century, people in Europe were desperate for timber. They were harvesting vast tracts of forests to meet a demand that seemingly couldn't be satisfied, and after some time people began to realize that there was no way this could keep going. So people became experts in the estimation of how much timber a forest could yield without irreparably harming the forest, starting by doing things like estimating a tree's timber productivity from its size, or sampling a plot of a forest to infer the whole forest.

In one story, this guy Johann Gottlieb Beckmann traced squares on a map that he was confident were representative samples of the forest, and sent people out to measure the sizes of the trees in their survey area. They'd hammer a color-coded nail into each tree they found, and when they got back Johann would just count up how many nails of each color were _missing_. If you sent someone out with 10 red nails and they came back with 4, then you could guess they found 6 of whatever kind of tree called for a red nail. You could work out from there a rough, but _actionable_, estimate of how many trees of varying sizes there were in the forest.

People in Europe took this idea and really ran with it. A whole field (hah, sorry) called "scientific forestry" emerged, and people thought about how to optimize forests for more productivity (it's a whole point that Scott makes that literally all anyone cared about was how many planks of wood you could get from a tree, but _we don't have time for that_). A German school of thought took hold - one that called for a whole system of maintaining forests with careful, absolute precision: they removed the underbrush, and the fallen leaves, and the fungus, and the wildlife; they removed and replanted the trees in a literal grid, like a pristine garden, with a single species of tree that they found was most productive - creating a **monoculture** ecosystem.

<!-- If you're really into nature, you might already notice what's wrong here: diversity is _kind of a big deal_ on Earth, and things tend to go wrong when we homogenize an ecosystem. -->

Scott writes that, for the first several decades, everything was going fine. But after 70 or 80 years - that is, after a generation of trees had run its full course - things went off the rails. Pests that thrived on Norway spruce (the tree species of choice) overwhelmed the forest, making clouds that people could hardly see through. And all the things that contribute to soil production - birds, insects, animals, etc... - had no place to go when foresters aggressively managed them out. All the trees being the same approximate age also made them all roughly equally vulnerable when storms arrived - there were no larger trees to take the literal fall for the smaller, younger trees. Something like 20-30% of the forest's productivity disappeared in the second generation, on track to lose more if things continued; a word entered the German vocabulary around that time: "_waldsterben_", or "_forest death_".

What people realized was that **diversity is what makes the ecosystem strong**. They began a process, spanning decades, to reintroduce spiders, ant colonies, fungi, birds, and other life back to the forests they had (metaphorically, although almost literally) hollowed out.

Slowly, the forests recovered.

What went wrong?

It was one thing when people who engaged in "scientific forestry" (as it was called) simplified the world as a means to _interpret_ it. It was necessary for them - and perhaps for all of us - to filter out things that aren't relevant to the decisions we make. We can't take it all in - it'll overwhelm us. If you trace a square on a map and hammer a nail into all the trees in that square according to how big they are, it's reductive but not necessarily interfering (granted, that nail probably didn't help). Scott is careful to carve out (sorry again) that he's _not_ saying that a simplifying function for interpreting the world is bad.

But it was a whole other thing when they turned that simplifying function back onto the world, now _shaping_ the world according to that reductive function they used to interpret it.
When you reshape the world to reflect the square you drew, you invade and disrupt all of the lives that interact with that forest - not just the birds and insects that make homes in those trees, but the people that live nearby and hunt (or live, or just hang out) in that area as well.

The point of the book is that states look for ways to make the world "legible", as messy and unorganized and complicated as it is, by thinking about things in very narrow, simplified contexts; and sometimes they _impose_ those simplified models back onto the world with disastrous consequences.

So I've read a lot about trees and now so have you. Why did you follow me on this journey? I wonder if there's a useful parallel to draw between this history and the phenomena we're seeing today with advertising, data mining, quantification, etc... that data scientists and engineers increasingly rely upon to make sense of the digital worlds they've created. We're not clickthrough machines, but that's how analytical systems often read us. And it's not necessarily calamitous when we build systems that help us interpret the world in simplified ways, but it _might_ become a problem when those systems begin to reshape the world according to the simple, digestible, but hollowed out metrics that we developed initially to _interpret_ the world.

Scott's book is about governments and the mistakes they make along these lines, but are we sure Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, and all of these other companies aren't, in their own ways, cultivating digital **monoculture** forests that are barreling toward disaster?

If this sparks any thoughts, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree (okay _really_ sorry, and I'm done).
