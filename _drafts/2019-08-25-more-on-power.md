CW: This post discusses sexual assault and suicide.

Recently it came to light that the MIT Media Lab took hundreds of thousands of dollars from Jeffrey Epstein, who was then and is now known to have raped an unknown number of children for decades before he was arrested, whereupon he committed suicide.

It's difficult to write that sentence, let alone absorb every part of its meaning.
It also doesn't address that Marvin Minsky,
who founded the MIT Media Lab, is now alleged to have participated in
the rape of children whom Epstein trafficked to
a private island as far back as 2001.
And with both of these men now dead, there may never be closure for the survivors.

In the aftermath, Ethan Zuckerman and Nate Matias announced that
they were leaving the Media Lab
(to the extents that they were affiliated with them:
in Ethan's case, he was leaving his professorship at the end of the 2019-2020 year;
in Nate's case, he would be migrating the projects running on Media Lab resources).

I've heard critiques and praise, and the fact is
I don't have a conclusive thought on these things.
The fact that it's convenient for them to leave now is true;
but it's also true that
at some point you wake up and can't get out of bed, and
you urgently need to remove yourself from an environment you now realize is toxic.

Nate and I are friends, and I think (or imagine) that
to some extent I appreciate what he's feeling:
as a child of immigrants,
as someone determined to try to make the world a better place,
as someone who has benefited from
people in power helping me into
the very institutions that I would later critique and undermine.
I can imagine how lonely, and betrayed, and alienated he might feel
if he were to discover that all of his values were not only not shared,
but actively undermined by
the institution with which he maybe had cautiously aligned all those years ago.

But these aren't the things I'm particularly ready to work through right now.
Maybe in some time, with more thought.
What I want to point to is that there were structural issues that led to this.

We urgently need to have more conversations about where our
power, and money, and influence come from.
We need to respect the people we work with, and 
bring everyone into these conversations.
Power potentially brings with it a poison that marks us all.
It may take decades to fully appreciate
the harm we perpetuated or even caused.
But that distance doesn't absolve us of responsibility.

Something that continues to worry me is that
the MIT Media Lab appeared, from this vantage point anyway,
to be in a position of immense privilege *already*.
They have
the status, wealth, and backing of MIT.
To turn away this money couldn't have spelled
the end of the Media Lab the way it might have meant the end
of other, smaller groups.

If these conversations couldn't be had at the MIT Media Lab,
what hope would there be for someone to raise this issue
in a group where funding is so much more precarious?
What hope does a junior researcher have to question these things,
if the underlying threat always appears to be that
their presence depends on
accepting this status quo, and perhaps on
never questioning it?

It's hard for me to escape the thought that
the segmentation of
discussions of finances from
those of ethics from
those of research led to all of this.
We need to shake loose that mindset.
We owe it to everyone
to use the MIT Media Lab as a cautionary tale and to insist that
we reflect on who supports us and how, and
to figure out how to navigate the inevitable conflicts.
