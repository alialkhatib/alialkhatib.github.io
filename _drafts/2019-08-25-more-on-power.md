CW: This post discusses sexual assault and suicide.

Recently it came to light that the MIT Media Lab took hundreds of thousands of dollars from Jeffrey Epstein, who was then and is now known to have raped an unknown number of children for decades before he was arrested, whereupon he committed suicide.

It's difficult to write that sentence, let alone absorb every part of its meaning.
It also doesn't address that Marvin Minsky,
who founded the MIT Media Lab, is now alleged to have participated in
the rape of children whom Epstein trafficked to
a private island as far back as 2001.
And with both of these men now dead, there may never be closure for the survivors.

In the aftermath, Ethan Zuckerman and Nate Matias announced that
they were leaving the Media Lab
(to the extents that they were affiliated with them:
in Ethan's case, he was leaving his professorship at the end of the 2019-202 year;
in Nate's case, he would be migrating the projects running on Media Lab resources).

I don't have a conclusive thought on these things.
The fact that it's convenient for them to leave now is true;
but it's also true that
at some point you wake up and can't get out of bed, and
you urgently need to remove yourself from an environment you now realize is toxic.

But these aren't the things I'm particularly ready to work through right now.
Maybe in some time, with more thought.
What I want to point to is that there were structural issues that led to this.

We urgently need to have more conversations about where our
power, and money, and influence come from.
We need to respect the people we work with, and 
bring everyone into these conversations.
Power potentially brings with it a poison that marks us all.
It may take decades to fully appreciate
the harm we perpetuated or even caused.
But that distance doesn't absolve us of responsibility.

Something that continues to worry me is that
the MIT Media Lab appeared, from this vantage point anyway,
to be in a position of immense power *already*.
They have
the status, wealth, and backing of MIT.
If these conversations couldn't be had at the MIT Media Lab,
what hope would there be for someone to raise this issue
in a group where funding is so much more precarious?
What hope does a junior researcher have to question these things,
if the underlying threat always appears to be that
their presence depends on
accepting this status quo, and perhaps on
never questioning it?


It's hard for me to escape the thought that
the segmentation of
discussions of finances from
those of ethics from
those of research led to all of this.
We need to shake loose that mindset.
We owe it to everyone
to use the MIT Media Lab as a cautionary tale and to insist that
we reflect on who supports us and how, and
to figure out how to navigate the inevitable conflicts.

I don't want to get too much into the merits and critiques of these decisions.
Yes, there are merits and issues with what they're doing.
I've said elsewhere that I'm proud of the decision they made, because
I can deeply understand the feelings Nate may have been going through.
I can imagine it having been incredibly alienating and depressing to discover that
the values that he held in his work and life were not only not shared, but
actively being undermined, in such an egregious way by Ito and the Media Lab.

But I also appreciate that this is something Ethan and Nate can do
only thanks to immense privilege -
both now professors,
both reasonably established,
leaving now that attention toward the Media Lab has soured.
In leaving, they leave the work of restorative justice for others to deal with.

I don't have a conclusive thought on these things.
The fact that it's convenient for them to leave now is true;
but it's also true that
at some point you wake up and can't get out of bed, and

I won't dwell on the precise details of the fallout
except to recap briefly that some researchers left MIT's Media Lab.
I can't claim to know what they were going through, and
my feelings are intensely mixed anyway.

On one hand,
it's the result of unfathomable privilege
to sever ties with an institution
once attention toward it turns overly sour.
It also leaves the question of
restorative justice for someone else to deal with.
What does the MIT Media Lab do from here that can be at all constructive?

On the other hand,
I can imagine myself in the position of Nate,
one of the researchers who left (and, coincidentally, my friend):
also the child of immigrants,
also the beneficiary of people in various positions of authority
helping me along the way,
also working for years to do something good with this institutional power that had
historically been used to harm people like me
(to say nothing of continuing to do so).
I can imagine feeling suddenly like
all of my work had been so deeply and thoroughly undermined.

In light of these facts, Ethan Zuckerman spoke with the director of the MIT Media Lab, Joi Ito, who took up the role in 2011, to try to better understand the MIT Media Lab's relationship today with these men. The result of that meeting was Zukerman's resignation, described in [his post here][Zuckerman resignation]. J. Nathan Matias, a visiting scholar of the Media Lab, also announced his disassociation from the organization in [his own post, here][Matias resignation].

There's a lot to work through here, but before we proceed I want to put pen to paper in some sense to say that
I can't begin to fathom how Nate's feeling - having worked as hard as he did and having spent as much time thinking as deeply as he has about how careful he has to be about the ethics and justice of his work, to have that work be tarnished by the Media Lab's decisions.
I know that he thinks deeply about these things because
I consider him a close friend, and because
our friendship and areas of work have given us
lots of opportunities to try to work through issues of research,
of justice, and
of our places in the world.

All I can do is to imagine myself,
also the child of immigrants,
also the beneficiary of people in various positions of authority helping me along the way,
also working for years to do something good with this institutional power that had
historically been used to harm people like me
(to say nothing of continuing to do so);
and to feel suddenly like all of my work had been so deeply and thoroughly undermined.

I wanted to put into more words than a few tweets could capture
that I get the gravity of the decision Nate had to make, and
the complexity of his feelings about it.
And if he feels anger and betrayal and depression,
that I get that too.

I find myself thinking about the people Nate and Ethan
worked hard to bring into the Media Lab -
the work they must have very consciously put
to giving disempowered people more power *through* the Media Lab -
and the feelings of shame and regret that
they might be feeling about bringing people into that environment,
even if they didn't know at the time any of this.
That I get that too.

And I get
that this is a problematic move for them for various reasons -
it's a move of immense privilege to get up and leave.
Where's the justice in benefiting from
this ongoing injustice for so long, and leaving now?
And where does that leave the Media Lab?
Without meaning to disparage the feeling that
*at some point you just can't be around these people anymore*,
it leaves the question of
restorative justice for someone else to deal with.

I don't have a good answer to any of these things.
The fact that
it's convenient to be able to leave the Media Lab
when attention turns sour is true;
it is also true that you can reach a breaking point, and
not be able to get up in the morning anymore
unless you make distance.
I'm not sure what to do with the conclusions of both -
that you can't stay, but neither can you go.
