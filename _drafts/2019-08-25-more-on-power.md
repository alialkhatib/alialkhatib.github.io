CW: This post mentions sexual assault and suicide.

Before you start, you might want to read [this op-ed by Kate Darling][oped] instead.
Her op-ed makes a more general point that I think is probably *more* worth reading.
I started this post wanting to make a more specific point, and
when I saw her post I realized I should just finish it and put it out into the world.

I'm assuming many of the people reading this post are all too familiar with the news of Epstein, of Minsky,
and maybe to a lesser extent of the MIT Media Lab.
In short,
the Media Lab took hundreds of thousands of dollars from Epstein over the past decade.
Many people have written about 


I don't really want to dwell too much on the people that left the Media Lab
(or the ones that stayed) in the aftermath, except to say that
my feelings on this are tangled up.
I appreciate the critiques people have made;
but I can also imagine how lonely, and betrayed, and alienated I might feel
if I were to discover that some of my values were not only not shared,
but actively undermined by
the institution with which I maybe had cautiously aligned all those years ago.
I can imagine how I would feel like I just need to get away, and how
it would be more about self-care than about making a statement for others to read into.


What I want to talk about is what made all of this possible.

### How did we all get to a point where an institution as powerful, as financially secure, as prestigious as the MIT Media Lab wasn't a psychologically safe environment for people to interrogate the sources of the funding that they were benefiting from?


But would we have been caught quite so much by surprise
if we fostered a culture where someone could
question and critique the funding sources and the collaborations
we develop without threatening their careers?


I guess I'm asking that question rhetorically;
on some level I know the answer, and I think many of us do too.
We relegate discussions about funding to the side, often happily, because
there are so many fields and departments adjacent to us that
don't even have the luxury to look a gift horse in the mouth.
But it's a Trojan horse; it brings with it all sorts of perils, and
if we don't address those now, we doom ourselves to deal with them later.

## It's precisely because we're offered all this power and money that we need to interrogate it.

I'm worried about our field being so closely aligned with industry.
But more than that, I'm worried about
how dangerous it apparently is that we can't even raise the issue meaningfully and in real terms,
except through anonymous twitter accounts or in this case as we leave,
perhaps burning bridges on the way out.


We need to talk about how the hell this happened.

We need to make it possible for people without the privilege to leave an institution like MIT
to have these conversations without endangering their careers or lives.

We need to do it urgently.
I think we need to do this before we do the other things.
And it needs to be all of us, because it implicates all of us, and
none of us is free of responsibility from this conversation.

We're all deep in it.
