I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this, but I know where it started: some thought-leader website wrote up a listicle of a handful of AI researchers that they think you should follow. I'm not going to link to it because I skimmed the list and most of them aren't worth following. There are dozens of listicles like this, and they always feature many of the same guys who have thought super deeply about how to game a benchmark test so that they get better results to... I guess make their multi-billion dollar tech company look like they're leading in AI. If there's a more consequential reason for giving a shit about this please feel free to let me know. (Does someone get a trophy or a sandwich or something?)

These lists are everywhere, so it's not like I'm grinding an axe over the existence of stupid listicles. This list in particular offered a number of AI researchers whose contributions are mostly technical and mostly uncritical. I'll grant *that* 

It'll be a grim future if our future history books tell of guys who made marginally better classification systems, and leave out people like Ruha Benjamin, who gave us words to talk about the problems these guys foisted upon us.
