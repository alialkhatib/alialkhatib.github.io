I wrote about the reasons [here][tweet], but the short version is I won't be attending CHI this year out of concern for a novel virus that authorities around the world seem to be struggling to contain. Since I want to intentionally foster the social relationships I would've nurtured if I had gone, I've decided to take my reading list and discussions about those readings online.

After skimming the titles, I came up with around 90 papers that piqued my interest.
After looking online, I was able to find around half of them online.
I haven't checked for tweets yet, but when I was drafting emails to ask people if they could share a preprint, Gmail locked me out for an indeterminate amount of time.

So... this'll be a slow process.

I figure it'll be easier to post the reading list, so here we go.
