I don't want to give people the impression that I'm handling things well, because I've started swapping the nozzles on my spray bottles and tweeting about the results, but the more I talk with people I care about the more I come to realize that, for reasons, I've had some experience with my world feeling inverted, with feeling or being stuck in my home, and with being utterly depressed as a result of that chaos. I don't know if any of this will help you, but if you haven't tried these tactics yet, they might be worth trying:

##### 1. Identify what I need to do, what I enjoy doing, & what's not going to get done

Step one for me is to pare down nonsense in my life. I can't overstate how important it is to make this a **conscious** step. I recognize that there are things I *need* to do to stay alive, and I outline how I can pare down my life so that - if all I need to do is stay alive - I have the bandwidth for that.

This is also where I ask myself if that's actually true. If I'm too depressed, don't have the time, don't have the money, or whatever else to get this level of stuff done, then this is where I identify that and reach out for help. If things get really bad, this is the first and only thing I need to do. This is, in a grim metaphorical sense, like sending a mayday signal as the plane tailspins. Nobody will know to come looking for me if nobody knows I'm going down. This person doesn't need to be local or in a position to fix everything, but 


I'm sure a lot of people are doing this themselves, but the angle that helps me is to conscientiously review this stuff and reassure myself that if I needed to scale back to just these activities, I have bandwidth to keep living. If at any point I'm afraid I don't have the energy, time, money, whatever to satisfy this stuff, this is absolutely the time that I reach out for help. Nothing else gets done if this doesn't get done, so no matter how anxious I feel about it, I need to get over it and ask for help.
