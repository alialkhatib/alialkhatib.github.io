Over the past few months I've been struggling to focus on work. I've been distracted, anxious, worried, but mostly I've been trying to reconcile the reshuffled priorities in my life and that I've been seeing in the world. I can share a few threads that I've been dwelling on that I'd like to share - and hopefully to work on going forward. I don't want to give the impression that this is an exhaustive outline of what I'm working on, but hopefully this sort of serves to trace the outline of the spotlight I'm using (don't overthink that metaphor).

## State panopticon
Basically I've been thinking of a few threads here. One of them is a reflection on means-tested and technocratically administered social welfare and support. the other is the surveillance state that's stretching its legs and seems to be getting ready to take off.

### Everyone deserves UBI, housing, justice, it turns out; how do we allocate this stuff?
There's a growing consensus that many of the problems the coronavirus pandemic has surfaced are at least exacerbated by aspects of our society that disproportionately harm people who have been marginalized by laws and society throughout history. Michigan's Black population - representing 14% of the state - [account for 40% of the deaths attributable to COVID-19](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-exposing-our-racial-divides/609526/). Cities and states across the country look demoralizingly the same. [People with disabilities are similarly experiencing and dying from COVID-19 at rates much higher than their respective counties and states experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html). Many workers in service industries have been designated as "essential", but not afforded things like guaranteed paid sick leave, sufficient health care assurances, personal protective equipment (PPE), or even a living wage.

Given the circumstances, even conservative politicians have come around to arguments for things like universal basic income, housing for all, and health care for all. In some cases, they're swallowing the pill by reminding themselves that these are now public health concerns that affect them. But how do we administer these benefits?

Congress has taken a swing at it, and it's been clumsy. $1200 for every American, with checks going out first to people who provided direct-deposit information in one of their recent tax returns. I won't get into the weeds about how we should have spent this money, but I will point to a few facts:

1. People who didn't provide direct deposit information (for instance, the "unbanked") won't get their checks until much later than the people who filed taxes and provided direct deposit information for their tax returns.
2. People who didn't bother to file taxes in recent years because they earned too little to make it worthwhile will have to go through a process that I'm not even clear on; the process of getting checks for these folks will be even longer than for the first group.
3. People living in the United States but not citizens won't receive a check at all. This consequently leaves out undocumented workers (among others).

Without underlining the point too much, these are some of the groups that most urgently need relief.

Existing bureaucratic and technical systems have simply not been designed and maintained to work at the scales we now need them to work. [IBM desperately and urgently moving to train people to code in COBOL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/ibm-scrambles-to-find-or-train-more-cobol-programmers-to-help-states/) is such a surface-level treatment of underlying negligence of basic principles of governance that it feels akin to trying to scoop water out of a sinking ship with a bucket. Code and structures of consequence in our lives should never have gone uninterrogated for that long. What the hell were we all thinking?







Frustratingly, it's taken this long for people to come around to the idea that people deserve to be confident that they won't be kicked out of their homes - an assurance the Department of Housing and Urban Development has reluctantly and meekly made by way of [an eviction moratorium announced just less than a month ago](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_20_042). [Congress passed legislation](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-house-vote/index.html) clumsily getting Americans $1200 ([and an additional $600 per week on top of existing unemployment benefits](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/senate-stimulus-unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html)).

All of this is great. I mean, it's garbage, but the status quo of our benefits and welfare programs has been so terrible that it probably isn't controversial to describe these programs as punitively difficult and unsupportive, all by legislative design. So it's not lost on me that we're 

Most of the people who are keeping many of us alive right now - gig workers, grocery workers, restaurant workers, drivers, couriers, warehouse workers, etc... - are today being forced to 

### How do we make sure people are social distancing?
People are talking about apps developed by Google and Apple "centered around privacy", but there are debates about the opt-in vs opt-out nature and the preference of [tech advocates to have tech companies debate this compared to the government imposing this](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm8W1fp8) (let's not get into the fact that really what's happening is that tech companies are deciding amongst themselves what we will have to put up with, and that governments are the entities that exist for public interest). the discourse around opt-in vs opt-out is pretty facile, though; what they don't talk about is the threat of apple outing people for not participating in some public health service. what's to stop apple from warning me that someone i'm hanging out with doesn't participate in the coronavirus network? the argument is right there on the table: someone who doesn't participate is, from their perspective, a threat to public health. never mind that the person not participating might have any number of reasons to not participate in a mesh network accounting for their locations over time.


## How do we avoid a divide?
There are two threads of issues that I see unfolding:
### information workers being micro-managed
There are folks who are being managed and paid by the minute they spend actually doing things designated as "productive" (e.g. only paying adjuncts for the time they spend screening lectures, but not for the other half of classes set aside for discussions such as [here](https://twitter.com/stephenwhitty/status/1249817683224399873?s=21).
## Harassment
## Water cooler/emotional wellbeing?
