A few months ago I was reading Forrest Stuart's _Down Out & Under Arrest_. In it, he writes about this idea called being _copwise_. At the risk of being overly simplistic, "cop wisdom" refers to the set of knowledge that a person who lives on the street in LA has to acquire to navigate a heavily policed space such as Skid Row successfully.
