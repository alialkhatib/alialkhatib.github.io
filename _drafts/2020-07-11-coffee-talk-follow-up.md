Last month I made blocks of time open to anyone who wanted to book 30-45 minutes to chat with me. I wrote about the idea [here][coffee talk], but the gist was that I wanted to make myself more available to people outside of my immediate network. I'm continuing the idea, but with a few modifications to my availability. You can look at upcoming availability [here][], but if you're curious about what I thought worked, what didn't, etc... then feel free to read on.

### What worked
I think it suffices to say that I got what I was hoping for out of this exercise. I met people outside of my immediate social network, geographically from all over the place (meaning all this stressing about the timezone stuff was at least a little rewarding), and I feel really good about the conversations I had. Some people had anxiety about grad school. Some people were trying to figure out how to bring theory from other fields into their own. Some people just wanted to talk through a conceptual framework that they weren't able to fully make sense of. These were tremendously rewarding conversations to have, even if I didn't have any particular insight for them.

*tl;dr: Listening to people: it's pretty good.*

I think being open-ended about what we would talk about was the right call too. I don't know what more there is to say about that except that I think literally everyone gave me some advance notice of what they wanted to talk about, and that gave me enough insight to put my head in the right place to talk about the things they wanted to talk about. I would encourage anyone replicating this to try doing that too (that is, ask the person booking an open-ended meeting to nevertheless state some agenda). I imagine if you're worried about harassment and whatnot this might be a good way to catch low-effort trolls and bad-faith actors.

*tl;dr: Have **some** agenda, just for the sake of having one.*

I don't remember whether everyone booked a 30-minute meeting or if some people booked 45-minute meetings, but they all *became* 45-minute meetings unless I absolutely couldn't run over time. I think there's a cold start problem and the first 5 or 10 minutes are just warmup time. 45 minutes just felt like they had a chance to land less abruptly.

*tl;dr: The 45-minute blocks were approximately long enough.*

### What didn't work quite as much
Mostly the stuff that didn't work was either unique to me or the consequence of my decisions.

I was exhausted at the end of just two back-to-back meetings and needed to lie down. I don't know how professors go back-to-back-to-back doing 1-1 meetings with their students all day. I'm going to change this so that there's always a 15-minute block after a meeting for me to lie down on the floor or something. Honestly, I might extend this to 30 or 45 minutes, but if I need to take 45 minutes to recover from a 45-minute meeting before heading into another, then I think I'll reevaluate how much energy I'm putting into meetings. I might simply need to pace myself better.

*Back-to-back meetings are #canceled. All meetings have nap breaks following them now.*

I think when meetings were constrained to 30 minutes, they didn't quite get a chance to stretch out as much as 45-minute meetings. I also don't think 45 minutes was enough to begin to feel like it was dragging - at least, not the conversations I had over the past month. I'm going to turn all of the meetings into 45-minute blocks because honestly that's how they always ended up turning out.

*30 minutes isn't enough for a first zoom meeting. Those are #canceled too.*

I didn't like that I had made myself available more or less every weekday for a few chunks here and there (ie staggered so that people in more timezones could find a day and time that worked for them). There would be nights that I was checking my calendar to see if I had an early meeting the next day or if it was canceled. I'm going to tentatively try making myself available for meetings one day per week from 7am to 5pm, hopefully still accomplishing the goal of being available to people across timezones, but not across days of the week. I'm not sure which day of the week makes sense, but I'll try Tuesdays.

(I thought about Mondays and Fridays, but ruled them out for different reasons that aren't terribly interesting.)

*I've got work to do. Except for Tuesdays, I guess. Tuesdays are #canceled.*

### What's changing
I'm going to adjust this plan on a continuing basis, and won't bother to update unless there's a really interesting insight that I want to share, but the gist is everything I listed above:

- more breaks between meetings
- longer meetings by default
- consolidate my availability to one day per week (Tuesdays for now)
- otherwise, everything was great; gonna keep doing it for now
