title: Conference Formats
---

I've been complaining about conference formats for a while and even after moving to [mastodon][masto] I feel like I don't have enough room to unpack my thoughts, so let's talk about why I think we have a ton of really interesting opportunities that we should really try for a hybrid, online-first, conference format - and what that would enable:

First, let's lay out the details of how this *could* work:

- speakers record their paper talks in advance
- those videos (and corresponding papers) get made available ~1-2 weeks in advance (whatever doesn't impose too great a burden on presenters or attendees)
- some Q&A format (temporary mastodon instance? Twitter? YouTube comments? Mail? Fax?) takes in questions and directs them to the session chair to filter and compile
- **paper sessions** stop principally being about presenting papers, and turn into **discussion sessions** about those papers
- CHI (potentially) makes space/time available for videos to be played immediately prior to discussion sessions
- the chair's job shifts toward mediation of conversation and comments, fielding and managing questions in-person while also reading out real-time comments from online attendees (this work could scale to multiple chairs depending on projected attendance numbers, or scaled in real-time if the chair finds themselves overwhelmed and feels comfortable tapping a known attendee to help moderate the online chat)
- CHI could either host the videos indefinitely (eg on YouTube) or say that they'll be public for a fixed amount of time, after which point they will *by design* be "forgotten"; speakers who want their talks available indefinitely would be able to re-upload their video on their own


Okay, I feel like my gripes about in-person paper sessions are well-known, but let's quickly go through them:

1. sitting in a dark room watching someone give a talk is perhaps the worst possible use of attendees being in-person
2. in-person talks are stressful, high-stakes, mostly "you can only hurt yourself" propositions
3. idk, i should have a third gripe lol

I understand the reasons for wanting conferences to be in-person again. Many of us who are begging for in-person conferences again are pining for an experience we had in the past that made us want to keep coming back to these rewarding experiences. And I totally agree that there are all these valuable experiences that you can get from attending a conference in-person. I always look forward to the conversations I have between sessions (or even during sessions, between meeting rooms) with people who are similarly frustrated with the state of the field, and working together to find the right words, the right framing, the right angle on what's wrong in HCI.

But I'm thoroughly not looking forward to spending 12 hours traveling in each direction for the purpose of sitting in a room, quietly taking notes, while someone struggles to get over their anxiety and nerves, to say nothing of technical issues and timing constraints imposed upon them by a conference that's falling increasingly behind schedule.

Lectures don't tend to benefit much from synchronous qualities, but discussions and conversations *do*. I consider the times that I'm synchronous with others to be *immensely* valuable and rare; there are vanishingly fleeting blocks of time every year that I share with people in real-time, in-person, and I emphatically feel that those times should be dedicated to uses that actually benefit from these features.

To me, that means not wasting my time with long lectures that could be (and increasingly these days *are*) recorded in advance; to me, that means dedicating every moment that we can be having an organic conversation to *actually having* a conversation of some sort.

So far, I've only talked about the functional, utilitarian aspects of the conference; I also want to point out how stressful, high-stakes, and unnecessarily fraught these in-person talks can be. I think we should also consider the impact that in-person talks have on the speakers, and how little justice we're doing to people we ask to come present their work.

In-person talks are stressful. You're jet-lagged, you're probably sleep-deprived from revising and practicing your talk at the last minute, and on the morning of the conference you have vanishingly little else on your mind except how to deliver this talk competently and effectively. English is my first language, and I did speech and debate in high school, and I *still* find this a harrowing and stressful experience. If I stumble over my words, or miss a line of my talk, or can't get the presenter display and the presentation display to show correctly with this new projector I'm connected to, that will haunt me at least for the rest of the day. There are only a million ways that the impression of yourself that you give audiences can be *undermined* by an in-person, one-shot talk. And there are, if any at all, few ways to come out of it having thoroughly impressed your audience.

I want every aspect of academia to be less stressful and lower-stakes than it currently is. We understand the basic premise that high-stakes paper submission models (annual submission deadlines) and binary review outcomes (accept/reject) are bad; in various HCI-related conferences we've moved to more frequent submission windows (not quite *rolling*, but getting there), and we've long-since moved to a format where we ask authors to revise and resubmit significantly more often. It has never been the case that a rejection should mean the end of this paper, but now we've codified that notion so that authors have a better feeling of the stakes being lowered. If your paper doesn't get accepted, it doesn't mean that you have personally been rejected as a human being; it means that this version of the paper you submitted probably needs more work, and you should try again with a revised version of this paper at the next round.

We can take that ethos and apply it to conference talks; we can give people substantially more time to get the talk delivery right, and we can do things like lean into the ephemeral nature of talks by making them unavailable after the conference (unless the speaker *wants* to make it available).

We can do all of this, *and* we can make it more reasonable for people with disabilities to participate in giving conference talks, either by constructing their talk in advance, or constructing *something else entirely* that satisfies the goal of introducing people to the paper in the form of a pre-recorded video. No more nonsense about rushing someone up to and down from the podium, no more hurriedly introducing speakers, no more overwhelming pressure on people with anxiety or depression or myriad other reasons for feeling prohibitively uncomfortable at CHI in-person.

third reason here? idk lol

I see the potential to have a conference where the materials we can have in advance - like the paper, like the talk, like pre-written questions - are all available in advance. And when we show up to these conferences all over the world, we go straight to richer, more satisfying interactive conversations with each other; the kinds of fluid conversations that zoom and slack and discord can't make possible.

In-person talks don't just disadvantage remote attendees who now have to watch a poor version of the talk through the camera of an iPad on a segway; they disadvantage everyone who went through airport security, who paid for travel documents, who flew around the world, and who booked expensive airbnbs or hotel rooms, all to spend time *not participating* in a room. It's not to my advantage to fly to Hamburg to see a talk in-person. I'm sure I'll appreciate it, but I doubt that I'll appreciate it more than if I went into the room and immediately got to start listening to a conversation between the speakers, or between the speakers and other attendees.

Recorded talks will let us prepare our talks in advance, but it's more than that: chairs can source a dozen or more questions to get the Q&A session rolling; people can watch and re-watch the talk, and read the paper, immediately before the session so that we can go back and clarify something we didn't grok initially, or misunderstood on first viewing. It can be a less stressful experience for the chair, for the speakers, and for the attendees, who can offload a lot of that stress to an asynchronous setting where things are recorded and prepared to the satisfaction of the people involved.

Okay, I'm running out of steam on this. It's too late to get this to happen at Hamburg this year, but I will always take the opportunity to point out that things don't need to be as stressful and as perilous as they are. We've just decided to make people miserable, stressed out, and scared; and we could just as easily decide to stop.
