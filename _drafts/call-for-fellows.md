I'm looking for research fellows to help with something that I'm really excited about. It's been on my mind for a while, and I think at this point I'll need help to go further. Okay, let's talk.

The short version is that I want to construct **a curriculum for data ethics** to give data scientists and other tech workers both epistemological *keywords* as well as some of the methodological *foundations* to work through issues in their work and workplaces.



# Job Title:
Applied Data Ethics Research Fellow

# Job Summary:
The Center for Applied Data Ethics (CADE) at the University of San Francisco is seeking applicants for research fellows in data ethics and algorithmic justice. The appointment will be for a minimum of 1 year, with the opportunity to extend for up to 1 additional year, depending on funding availability.

This position is open to applicants from a broad range of disciplines and backgrounds. In particular, we are seeking applicants whose experience and training will inform the design and implementation of a curriculum on data ethics and algorithmic justice focusing on methods and foundations that will enable students of this curriculum to productively interrogate, analyze, and understand the paradigms and contexts within which many of these students will eventually work.

# Full Job Description:
## Research fellows will do the following:
### for the first 3-6 months
- Conduct and produce original research or advocacy (estimated commitment: 20 hours per week)

{{Ali: original description below:}}

- Producing original research in the area of tech ethics. This can take many forms, whether it is traditional academic research, working with a Data Institute partner company or nonprofit on ethical issues and developing a case study, or in creating other original programming around data ethics.
- A teaching and educational component that may include designing and teaching a course to USF undergraduates; supporting the course development for Director of CADE including continuing education evening courses open to those already working in tech; and designing and leading workshops open to the community.
- Dissemination of research by sharing work through papers, blog posts, and speaking at conferences (industry, open source, or academic).
- Involvement with events at the USF Data Institute, including interacting with researchers in other Data Institute programs, attending seminars, and meeting with Data Institute partner companies and nonprofits.

The USF Data Institute serves as the umbrella organization for data science education, research and programming at USF. The Data Institute offers the MS in Data Science (MSDS), BS in Data Science (BSDS) and continuing education certificates, hosts interdisciplinary postdoctoral fellows, and is home to initiatives focused on applied data ethics, AI in medical research and environmental science. The MSDS and the BSDS programs, with the support of the Data Institute, are interdisciplinary degree programs with a diverse and growing community of full-time faculty members from data science, mathematics and statistics, and computer science.

# Training and opportunities the fellows will receive include:
{{Ali: not sure how useful this stuff is}}
Research funding to support travel and dissemination of research. Access to the computing resources at USF and the Data Institute that includes GPU clusters as well as Amazon Web Services resources. Teaching opportunities (no more than 1 course per year) in the candidate's area of specialty in undergraduate, continuing education, or community courses. Access to specialized courses established at the Data Institute and the graduate programs at USF including in deep learning, databases, large-scale computing, statistical modeling and other areas of data science to complement the fellow's current training and expertise. Opportunity to mentor or co-mentor graduate students on practicum projects, which will expose the fellow to practical ethical data science problems in industry.


{{Ali: I don't like these qualifications requirements - if we want people who have been spending their time as activists, their paper qualifications might not correspond clearly to these.}}

## Minimum Qualifications: Graduate Degree in the applicant's area of research.
## Preferred Qualifications: PhD or equivalent terminal degree.

The data science faculty at USF and the Data Institute pursue academic excellence and are committed to fostering an environment in which faculty, staff, and students from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and personal experiences are welcomed and can thrive.

This position is a temporary position. The term (length) of the position is dependent on the funding to cover the total compensation of the position. This position will be reviewed periodically to ensure funding still exists.
