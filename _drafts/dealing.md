Let's start over. I don't particularly enjoy talking about bipolar disorder, or depression, or mania.
I could rattle off reasons that would satisfy people:
It brings up intensely uncomfortable memories;
it feels presumptuous to write even about *my own* experiences, because it would imply that my experience is somehow authoritative and speaks for others' experiences;
I don't want to become *the guy with bipolar disorder* in my social circle, answering questions and being called upon to represent people with mental disorders;
it reveals some weakness about myself, and years of my particular upbringing has taught me not to do that.

None of these reasons feel very convincing as I write them.
For some reason, they just don't resonate perfectly with me the way other things resonate as truth for me.
I know that somewhere, some series of words out there perfectly captures my reticence to write about it, but I can't find it.

All of this is a *very* roundabout way of saying that I'm fighting my instincts to write this, so...
if this is awful, cut me some slack or whatever.
I'm trying to put these words down on paper because I'm having trouble putting *any other words* on paper.
For a PhD student, whose job is to put words on paper, that's a problem.
The only thing that your brain seems willing to help you write about is something you profoundly wish not to talk about.
But maybe, like an itch, I just need to scratch this so I can square it away and get back to other things.

Depression can be profoundly frustrating.
In high school I was missing classes and exams and homework assignments;
I couldn't bring myself out of this fog, and it showed.
Ultimately, I didn't walk at graduation, short a few credits because I had failed so many classes that there wasn't even enough time to make them all up by the end of senior year.

Community college wasn't much better.
