title: "Untitled for the Algorithm"

I've been writing a bit about algorithmic systems - and especially thinking about AI harms and justice - for a while now, and I have a few stuck thoughts that I want to lay out on the table. I'm trying to find structure and order as I go, so I'll just outline some of the major topics that come to mind:

1. are large language models going to replace art/writing/???
2. how should i feel about people promising a future where AIs handle emails or do various administrative tasks?
3. what's this about AIs generating bullshit?
4. ????

okay let's get to it

### replace art?
I've been noticing something about how people talk about chatGPT replacing writers or stable diffusion replacing artists; a lot of the people who excitedly promise a future where these systems "defeat" artists or "solve" art or something stupid - they often describe themselves as not being interested in the subject.

Let me explain what I mean: someone entered an AI-generated piece into an art competition and won first place under the false pretext that it was created by a person. Then they used that award as evidence that art was finished, or defeated, or something.

But they *described themselves* as "not artists".

That seems important to me for two reasons. there's the micro level and then there's the macro level. On the micro level, they're making editorial decisions about how to prompt the system, what output to accept, how to fine-tune the results, whether and where to submit the piece, etc...

... I know that we're not talking about a person picking up a paintbrush or getting back pain hunched over a wacom tablet, but... artistic liberties were certainly involved here, right?

Then there's the macro level to this - let's say that I ignore that point about how a person did make decisions upstream, and they may feel no ownership over it, but they were the last ones to touch the ball, so to speak...

let's ignore that.

The shapes and colors that the AI generated isn't what I think of when I think about art *per se*. I don't really want to get into whether that piece means anything to you, or to me, or to anyone... but there was no communicative intent behind that piece coming from the AI, because AIs don't have communicative intent. So... it's pretty shapes, i guess? but that's it.

what I get from art - whether it's a painting, or sculpture, or essay, or video, or shredded confetti - what I get is a window into the person or the people who made that piece. Maybe they're saying how they view the world, or the cosmos, or their love, or they're interrogating foundational ideas about perspective or geometry... but art is this incredibly communicative format yielding a glimpse into the mind of the artist.

so this is where i get off the train; AIs don't really have a mind or anything like that in the way we mean when we say that word. There's no phenomenological experience of the world, so they have nothing to intentionally convey to us. There's these neural nets, and they produce an emulated output that we can easily mistake for thought, but... people have been doing that since ELIZA, and that was like 40 or 50 years ago, and it didn't have anything complicated like neural nets or machine learning.

I'm getting off track; the philosophical concept of art is heady shit, and my point is that i'm less worried that AI will replace art and all that, and more worried that people won't care that they're not getting anything representing an intentional message from an artist - satisfied, instead, to consume pretty shapes to kill time.

and don't get me wrong - i'm sure AIs will produce really pretty decorations for hotel rooms to fill space. and i'm even sure that people will read into those

I've been thinking a lot about the bullshit that chatGPT and other large language models generate, and whether all this bullshit says anything about AI in general, about large language models specifically, or about anything else obliquely.
I think I'd been circling this thought for some time, maybe because it didn't feel like a particularly large connection to draw, and I'
