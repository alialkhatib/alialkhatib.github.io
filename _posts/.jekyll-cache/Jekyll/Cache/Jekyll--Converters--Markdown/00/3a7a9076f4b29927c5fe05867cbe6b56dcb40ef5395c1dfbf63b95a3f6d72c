<p>This class was ridiculous. I continue to find that these geographically focused Anthro courses are miles away in terms of rigor compared to anything else I’m taking. I found myself thinking the same things as this quarter came to an end as I felt near the end of Anthro 164P (Eastern Europe and Central Asia):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh god, I don’t know anything about this region. I’m a fraud. How can I expect to pass this class? I don’t know <strong>anything</strong> about this place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… and then proceeding to hyperventilate. But I’m beginning to get savvy to this feeling of not knowing. I know that a big first step in learning about a region or a group of people is the simple fact of knowing that you know so little about a group with so many little nuances, quirks, and exceptions to the rule. At least I know that much now.</p>

<p>This class pleasantly surprised me as well, though. I hadn’t anticipated a discussion on the ethics of sharing information via Aaron Swartz in the context of this class. I might have expected, to some degree, a conversation about binarism, technology, and the IT industry in India, but I definitely didn’t think I would be invested in a conversation about it at the meta level I took it to. And I want to emphasize that <strong>I took it to that meta level</strong>. If you know me, you know that I hate getting dragged into that, but this time I dragged <strong>you</strong> there over the course of a series of blog posts. You’re very welcome. Or thank you. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>I hardly expected to find myself talking about the race relations of Whites and Blacks in America, but I found over the past ~10 weeks that India and its relationship with Britain paralleled cultures, conflicts, and relationships all over the world in fascinating ways. It’s one thing to notice those connections, and I would be happy if I came away with that, but the entirely new way of seeing how cultural relations between the West and the “other” can share some common ground with other cultures. <em>Machines and the Measure of Man</em> got me thinking about the way India and Africa were in the same boat when it came to their relationship with the West: that of marginalization, oversimplification, and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I hope I can take this new approach and insight with me to other subjects. I feel like I’ve gained a foothold in a whole area of Anthropology about which I was never really cognizant before. These approaches have certainly made the takeaway from this class that much better, and I can only imagine the same effect on other subjects and regions.</p>
