I"<p>For the past year Iâ€™ve been studying the culture of Quantified Self. Last weekend I gave a talk on the research at the <a href="//www.urop.uci.edu/symposium.html">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Symposium</a>, and in the spirit of QS culture (especially with regard to open access to data, etcâ€¦) I thought Iâ€™d post the presentation. The PowerPoint is <a href="/media/presentations/QS.ppt">here</a> (warning: 12.9 MB). Alternatively, you can download a PDF <a href="/media/presentations/QS.pdf">here</a> (9.8 MB).</p>
