I"é<p>My last substantive post was about how broken graduate school applications are, so I think it makes sense that my next post would be about graduate schools again.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of the last few months worrying that my statements of purpose wouldnâ€™t be well-received. Not because I worried that I hadnâ€™t written my SoPs well, or because my research wasnâ€™t interesting (well, to me anyway), but because I was afraid that I had been on the fence for too long, so committed to interdisciplinary studies that I had forfeited my stake in both social sciences and computer science. I was afraid that I was too quantitative for qualitative fields (like Anthropology) and too qualitative for quantitative fields (like Computer Science).</p>

<p>Several months ago I got a call from Stanford. I went for a visit, and Iâ€™ve signed the proverbial papers; Iâ€™ll be joining Stanfordâ€™s Computer Science program to pursue a PhD. Specifically, Iâ€™ll be studying digital cultures and working in the HCI group (after the initial year of rotations).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still settling into the bizarre turn of events, especially the lingering misgivings Iâ€™ve had about ultimately leaving the social sciences, which got me into academia in the first place (and where I feel my research interests belong), but after speaking with Michael Bernstein, Jure Leskovec, Dan Jurafsky, Chris Re, and others, I really canâ€™t imagine being anywhere but Stanford and in Computer Science.</p>

<p>It just happens to be really convenient that the clout associated with CS at Stanford affords me immense credibility in some circles.</p>

<p>More updates eventually. Iâ€™m trying to stay above the day-to-day errands of housing lotteries and personal stuff because I kind of assume nobody reading this is interested. My next unprompted post will <em>probably</em> be about Quantified Self, the undergraduate thesis Iâ€™ve been working on for the honors Anthro program at UC Irvine, for which Dr. Boellstorff has been advising me.</p>
