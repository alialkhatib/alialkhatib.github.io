I"ˆ<p>Today was my second day of lab/babysitting sick people so that Vanessa can hopefully get some work done. Yesterdayâ€™s catalog was easy - making a catalog of artifact fragments on which weâ€™ll be doing XRF analysis (someday), but today I was tasked with cleaning the recent finds from the field, mostly ceramics caked in hard dirt.</p>

<p>The weather here is best described as inconsistent, or perhaps consistently erratic. Thereâ€™s no way of predicting what todayâ€™s climate will look like, so youâ€™re supposed to prepare for a little bit of everything. In Spanish, the word to describe the drizzle which sometimes showers us with light rain is called â€œparamoâ€.</p>

<p>Yesterday Matt, Sofia, others, and I considered places to go for our upcoming 3-day weekend. The other staff members mentioned going to various resort locations like Mindo or BaNos, but Iâ€™m not sure that I donâ€™t feel like splitting from the group and going somewhere difficult on my own. I considered Colombia, but Iâ€™m on the fence because of the reported danger to American tourists. Then again, a guyâ€™s gotta live, right?</p>

<p>After lunch today my ceramics cleaning partner (Kenny) and I noticed a fire near the hacienda rooms, so we put the fire out. I should remind myself later to update my LinkedIn profile to say â€œArchaeologist, firefighterâ€.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s some trouble with the databases, not just in that there are multiple databases but in that people are actually having trouble with them. Iâ€™m considering pushing to MySQL/PHP, which should be easier to use but might be harder to learn. I need to come up with a solution which is easy enough to learn.</p>

<p>The pigs at this hacienda almost ate some of our ceramics. Stupid pigs.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t help but start to feel the impact of knowing that I wonâ€™t see some people back home very much (if at all). I donâ€™t mind losing some people, but othersâ€¦</p>
