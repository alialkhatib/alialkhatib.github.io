I"ü<p>This is one of those times that I should be focusing on something more important, but thereâ€™s always something more important that I should be doing (certainly more important than writing on a personal blog Iâ€™m maintaining for my own sanity and reflections).</p>

<p>Where was I? Ah, yes, graduate school applications.</p>

<p>For the moment, I donâ€™t want to say â€œpubliclyâ€ where Iâ€™m applying, but Iâ€™m applying to a small handful of pretty prestigious universities. People tell me Iâ€™m absolutely going to get into several of these places, particularly since Iâ€™ve spoken with (and apparently impressed) at least one faculty member at one university. Iâ€™ve never shared in my friendsâ€™ confidence, but itâ€™s reassuring that people have confidence in me.</p>

<p>This process has caused me to reflect more on the transition Iâ€™ve made since I was essentially a flunky in high school. I still think I was intelligent - or perhaps more accurately, bright - but I wouldnâ€™t characterize my high school self as particularly motivated or ambitious. It took me a few years before I would figure out what the hell I wanted to do with my life, and Iâ€™m sometimes reticent about that period of my life out of shame, but I know on an intellectual level that I couldnâ€™t have met the people Iâ€™ve met (or had the experiences Iâ€™ve had) if I hadnâ€™t taken this winding, tumultuous journey.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still somewhat concerned, occasionally, that my area of research is so ambiguous or such a black sheep that I wonâ€™t find anyone who will want to take me. Certainly one leaning or another (either harder sciences or softer sciences) wonâ€™t want to take me on, and some level of prestigiousness will just cut me off at the door with a â€œno thank youâ€ followed by an abrupt slam. Iâ€™ve done a remarkable (even disconcerting) amount of background research on various prospective faculty, however, and Iâ€™m confident Iâ€™m applying to work with the right people, or at least to work at the right places.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have any regrets about the path Iâ€™ve taken, or where I hope to go from here. Iâ€™ve certainly made mistakes, but I ultimately never completely squandered an opportunity to learn a new lesson.</p>

<p>With that being saidâ€¦</p>

<h1 id="grad-school-apps-suck">grad school apps suck</h1>

<p><strong>We need better ways of aggregating graduate school deadlines and requirements</strong>. I refuse to believe that Iâ€™m the first person to notice this (edit: I know for a fact that others hate this process just as much or more than I do; some of them are even <a href="//jeffhuang.com/rethinking_the_phd_application.html">on the other side</a> of things). As soon as I have a few weeks off (read: never) Iâ€™m going to look into aggregating this kind of information if itâ€™s at all pragmatic. All I really need/want is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>well-formed data points of universities</li>
  <li>well-formed data points of programs therein</li>
  <li>well-formed data points of programsâ€™ corresponding deadlines</li>
  <li>well-formed data points of requirements to apply (<em>would be nice?</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m thinking it could be implemented pretty quickly: Either server-side (PHP has regex, right?) or client-side (I <em>know</em> JS has regex) scraping of a few pages for something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r'deadline+*?(December|January) \d+'</code> (case-insensitive hopefully).</p>

<p>I write that but I <strong>know</strong> UC Berkeley uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table</code> elements to neatly lay out their <a href="//grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/list.shtml">deadlines</a>. Thanks, Berkeley! (<em>cough please admit me cough</em>)</p>

<p>So if the university uses tables, that might be easier because you just grab the nth table in every row (except the ones which simply repeat the header). Otherwise just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regex.search</code> (in python at least) for anything along the lines of the above pattern.</p>

<p>The implementation is â€œjankyâ€ to be generous, but the need is there, so I think itâ€™s worth pursuing. Iâ€™m <strong>not</strong> saying we need a Common App for grad school (with students firing buckshot at graduate admissions committees, inundating them with obviously unserious applications), but grad applicants could be better informed about deadlines, requirements, and faculty. Thereâ€™s no good reason that this shouldnâ€™t all be in one place (to some extent, you could argue that <a href="//scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> is an index of sorts). I bet most grad applicants will have created their own index of faculty at myriad universities with recent publications, research areas, and contact info. I know I did.</p>

<p>You can argue that this is good practice for doing legwork and research (something grad students should get used to), or that this is all part of the challenge. This is specious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your grad applicants need practice doing research, theyâ€™re not viable candidates in the first place</li>
  <li>If you want to assess our ability to do background research, this is a bad way because
    <ol>
      <li>you only effectively see the background research we did for <em>your</em> institution, and</li>
      <li>this is a symbolic challenge, and symbolic challenges are hollow.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I make the emphatic preemptive case justifying making graduate school applications easier to sort out, but there really only needs to be one reason, and itâ€™s a positive reason rather than ruling out a bunch of negative ones:</p>

<h2 id="we-should-make-graduate-school-applications-easier-because-then-they-would-be-easier">we should make graduate school applications easier because then they would be easier.</h2>

<p>We do our best to make processes and activities easier specifically to free up cognitive burdens for other things. Rather than every future Nobel Laureate wasting dozens of hours <em>individually</em> on background research and legwork, just get it out of the way now. Sort that shit out once so all of the brilliant minds of the future can more quickly get to whatever cancer-curing, peace-brokering, wheelie-popping awesomeness theyâ€™re destined to do.</p>

<p>So over the next few weeks Iâ€™ll be posting more about my adventures in grepping content from admissions websites.</p>

<p>If this (project/task/person) sounds interesting, keep following my posts (here) and look for a Github repository somewhere down the road - cool things seem to be found in Github repos a lot :)</p>
