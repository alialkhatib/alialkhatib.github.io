I"D<p>Yesterday I had a rough day, mostly consisting of me oversleeping - something I rarely do anymore. I don’t sleep much in the first place, so a few hours more is like doubling my sleep. It sounds nice, but it’s disruptive.</p>

<p>I completely flaked on a kid I was tutoring in Statistics, which consistently makes me feel pretty shitty. I hate letting people down. It wasn’t made better by realizing later that I wasn’t doing as well in a class as I thought. I think I can pull things back up in the next week or so, but it’s worrying nonetheless (and not just because I practically make a career out of worrying).</p>

<p>It’s just a stressful part of the academic year: My Anthro study is wrapped up and I need to write the paper, prepare the presentation, and ultimately give a talk about it in… fewer than two days. Add to that another presentation on a psych study (comparing learning and memory when reading on <strong>paper</strong> versus a <strong>computer screen</strong>), and preparing for the Ecuador program (for which I leave in just over a week).</p>

<p>Oh and that Psych class - I <em>stupidly</em> opted to do an alternative project to the lab rat program the school established where students take part in psych studies. It seemed like too much work. The alternative project? A 5 page critique of an established psych study. That’s due either this Thursday or next Monday. Neither option sounds appealing. And <em>this is the class I’m concerned about</em>, to add salt to the wound.</p>

<p>I can’t say I haven’t learned a lot this quarter, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t being overworked (just a little bit). Hopefully Ecuador will be a little low-key, and I’ll be able to relax and enjoy the 11,000 foot high altitude (and short-term altitude sickness) for the whole month of July.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
