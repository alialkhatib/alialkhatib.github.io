I"y<p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time looking at lots of data from various sources (San Francisco, Chicago, and whatever else I can get my hands on). It’s been kind of interesting, but ultimately all I can tell you based on the data is that people sleep at night and cops tend to get called more around lunch. Actually, that last bit is interesting.</p>

<p>Actually, come to think of it, we see a bit of a spike in crimes around 8pm, 12pm, and 6pm (all typical meal times for normal people if I remember my time as a human being accurately).</p>

<p>I’ve done some other data visualization stuff with R, a little bit of Photoshop and Illustrator, and lots of frustrated tinkering, but it falls into the “neat, but so what?” bin:</p>

<p>I need to get back to work on the stuff I’m actually assigned. Maybe I’ll post about that stuff this week.</p>
