I"n<p>I’ve been getting graded really harshly in these lab assignments lately and I’m beginning to feel worse about my ability to code and do well in classes and all of that.</p>

<p>But then I read about <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp0_on_fire">this</a>; it’s an error code jokingly made to indicate that the device was on fire.</p>

<p>I’ve never set anything on fire with my code. I can be proud of that.</p>

<p>Also my professor laughed at me when I told him I was worried about my grade. Apparently he’s planning on curving final scores quite a bit. This made me lose sleep so I’m glad to hear it.</p>
