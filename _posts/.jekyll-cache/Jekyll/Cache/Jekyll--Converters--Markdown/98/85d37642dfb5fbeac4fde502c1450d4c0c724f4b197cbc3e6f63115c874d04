<p>I landed in Quito with another student without incident. Our incident was awaiting us, since I had recently received an email from the hostel I booked, telling me they were actually completely full. After a few different flights, we both found ourselves landing in Quito at the same time and we decided to head into town to look for a hostel like any other dumb tourists - by walking door to door.</p>

<p>After a few tries, we found a very polite lady who had availability for 2 nights (which suited me just fine), so we booked it. $9 per bed per night <em>isnâ€™t bad at all</em>.</p>

<p>We explored, eventually met up with some other staff members who arrived early as well (the other student was here as a participant, but weâ€™re quickly learning that sheâ€™s as good as staff), and then turned in, anticipating the next morning. That came, and went, and we woke up at about 10am, a few hours later than we planned on meeting with some friends to explore Quito.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we met up later at The Magic Bean (a restaurant named in honor of Shel Silverstein, the ownerâ€™s favorite, hopefully). It was great seeing all of the familiar faces from past field schools, and I canâ€™t wait to get to work with them as staff this time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m more than a little concerned about one staff member, but thereâ€™s always one whoâ€™s a little slower on the uptake. If it wasnâ€™t her, itâ€™d be someone else whoâ€™s not as reliable as everyone else. No point really in dwelling on it unless it poses a serious hazard. On one or two occasions I was afraid I saw something indicative of that, but hopefully sheâ€™ll wise up before she puts herself in serious danger.</p>

<p>Touring Quito has been breathtaking, and Iâ€™m not just saying that because the altitude is making it difficult to breathe - although really, <strong>that too</strong>. Photos will be upcoming, but in the meantime, <em>holy shit; heights</em>.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Iâ€™m taking a bus out to Cangahua with the rest of the staff at 11am. Thatâ€™s in 6.5 hours, so I want to get to the rendezvous point in 5 hours, and I need to pack (so I should get started on that in 4.5 hours, maybe 4), which means itâ€™d be ideal to be awake in 3.5 hours, soâ€¦ Not sure about sleeping tonight, actually.</p>

<p>I feel oddly energetic, given the natural difficulty breathing at this altitude. I really canâ€™t stress enough that breathing up here - particularly when hiking up hills - is enormously challenging.</p>

<p>Then again, itâ€™s really cold, and Iâ€™m quite tired. Iâ€™m going to set my alarm for a few hours from now and hopefully I wonâ€™t sleep through it. If I do, then fuck. Otherwise, hopefully Iâ€™ll put some photos up (and more posts) in a few days.</p>
