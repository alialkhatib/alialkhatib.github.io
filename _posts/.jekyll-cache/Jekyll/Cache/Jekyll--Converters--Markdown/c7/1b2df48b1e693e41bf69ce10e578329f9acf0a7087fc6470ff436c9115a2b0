I"ı<p>About a week ago I deactivated my Facebook account. I went through the whole process of disabling all of the hapless shit Facebook does to keep me tied in (the periodic emails, the notification emails in case my friends say stuff I might care about, etc‚Ä¶) and entered the confirmation code, and that was that.</p>

<p>How often do I see the Facebook login screen? Not very.</p>

<p>Anyway, I went on my merry way for a few days until suddenly I started getting some notifications in my Notification Center. Stuff like ‚Äúdid ali deactivate his facebook? his name is black and I can‚Äôt click on it‚Äù and all that. But I was only getting notifications about the group chat I was in when I deactivated my account (obviously people weren‚Äôt writing on my wall or messaging me directly, since my account doesn‚Äôt outwardly exist anymore).</p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, Notification Center still has some remnant access to things in Facebook to which only <em>I</em> should have access. Except since <em>I</em> shouldn‚Äôt really exist according to Facebook‚Äôs privacy logic, this makes no sense.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure if the issue is some old token/credential giving any arbitrary holder (fortunately in this case the original holder) access to a person‚Äôs conversations even <em>after</em> deactivating his/her account</p>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<p>if this is just Facebook keeping my name/identity in the chat list (which makes sense) but somehow failing to disconnect the notification bit that would naturally disconnect when your account is deactivated. If that‚Äôs the case, there‚Äôs still the matter of why my Notification Center was able to access them (let alone why it was <em>pushed</em> those messages).</p>

<p>I‚Äôve asked a friend to try sending another message to the group chat, hopefully with something pithy like ‚ÄúI think Ali‚Äôs eavesdropping on us‚Äù. I‚Äôll update if I catch a notification in-progress.</p>
