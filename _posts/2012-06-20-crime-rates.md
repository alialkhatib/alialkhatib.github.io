I've spent quite a bit of time looking at lots of data from various sources (San Francisco, Chicago, and whatever else I can get my hands on). It's been kind of interesting, but ultimately all I can tell you based on the data is that people sleep at night and cops tend to get called more around lunch. Actually, that last bit is interesting.

Actually, come to think of it, we see a bit of a spike in crimes around 8pm, 12pm, and 6pm (all typical meal times for normal people if I remember my time as a human being accurately).

I've done some other data visualization stuff with R, a little bit of Photoshop and Illustrator, and lots of frustrated tinkering, but it falls into the "neat, but so what?" bin:

I need to get back to work on the stuff I'm actually assigned. Maybe I'll post about that stuff this week.
