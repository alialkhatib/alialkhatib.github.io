I submitted a paper to a conference a few weeks ago (you can figure out the details if you want to dig through [my github repo], but I'm reluctant to point a metaphorical flashlight at it until the review process has run its course). Since the submission, I've mostly been thinking about what larger arc of research I want to try to explore from here. It'd be nice to keep my head above water just by getting *any* papers published, but I get the feeling that if my next move can be informed by *some* intuition about the big picture, the narrative thread of my story will be that much stronger at the end, when I tell it retrospectively (read: when I'm working on my dissertation).

One idea that's come out of this line of thought has been that — sometimes — papers seem to speak on several levels. You might appreciate a paper as a quick read because of the thing it did (maybe the author(s) built a thing, or explained a thing (those are the only types of contributions, right?)), and that's great. But a more careful reading would show that the paper is actually illustrating a new way to think about and make sense of the world, often by advancing the field in some way. One example of this kind of thing is _[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]_ by Bronisław Malinowski; his work wasn't just an ethnography of Trobrianders (it _was_ that too, but it's not required reading for Anthro students purely because of how interesting the *Kula exchange* is (although it really is interesting, you should go check it out)). Its lasting contribution was guidance and illustration on how to conduct rigorous ethnographic fieldwork. Malinowski was obviously aware of this contribution, but to a large extent he needed to introduce it showing it in practice — in this case, in Papua New Guinea.

So if the paper that I just wrote has a _meta point_, it's that a historical lens can helpfully explain some of the stuff that we're seeing today. Maybe it's not a hugely earth-rocking realization, but in my community it's at least a point worth making more forcefully (if it's even been made in the past).

So lately I've been thinking about other ways that I can apply this _meta point_, and hopefully I'll post more soon fleshing out some of the possible next research areas to help make that argument.
