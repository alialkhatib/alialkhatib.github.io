title: Streaming (and (maybe) Street Performances)

Lately I've been thinking about the ways people make money on the
internet. I've spent some time thinking about people on Amazon
Mechanical Turk, as well as on sites of work like Uber, Lyft, etc... but
there are other platforms online where people work under different
conditions, and I'm always looking for something more fringe, less
explainable by the research we have, and just more **interesting**. I
guess this is a long–winded way of justifying watching lots of YouTube
videos lately.

I've seen a few research papers about streaming (e.g. see [[5][], [3][], [8][]) but I'm thinking
about something that only kind of intersects with these works.

Kaytoue et al. [[5][]]
look at streaming particularly through the lens of professional
**gamers**, which I parse out as separate from professional streamers
and YouTubers because the latter group (which I'll call "performers") is
getting paid for the performance rather than the activity, if that makes
sense. To put it another way, putting aside things like sponsorships and
whatnot, if people stopped watching gamers stream, they would still make
money from winning, being part of a professional, (relatively
conventionally) compensated team, etc...

Hamilton, Garretson, and Kerne [[3][]]
get a little closer to what I'm talking about — it talks about the
social aspects of streaming on Twitch, accumulating followers, engaging
with the community, etc... but I'd like to get more into the
relationships that form among performers, as well as the relationships
that performers develop with the *platform* (whether that's YouTube or
Twitch or whatever).

To be more direct about what I think I'm interested in, or to define it
in positive terms rather than negative ones, I'm thinking about the
people that make their living *by* streaming (instead of maybe *while*
streaming). Maybe the second point here is thinking about
the "[Meta Points][]" post I wrote a while
back, and how we're lacking historical framing on the stuff we're seeing
today. Whether that historical framing answers some questions about
these things is still kind of up in the air, but I think it helped me
make sense of gig work and micro–tasks, and I see a few questions in
online streaming and video productions that seems kind of open still.

One of the major questions seems to be wrestling with the power that
platforms have over performers, and how the organizations that operate
these platforms should negotiate with performers that don't necessarily
follow the rules. Street performance art seems like a good analogy for
people that perform through online platforms (actually, Cracked uses
that exact analogy in [a recent
video][]!). So I've been
looking through a few pieces that look informative, leading to…

- _Drawing a circle in the square: street performing in New York's Washington Square Park_ by Harrison- Pepper [[4][]]
- _Radical street performance: An international anthology_ by Cohen-Cruz [[1][]]
- _Street Performers and Society in Urban Japan, 1600-1900: The Beggar's Gift_ by Groemer [[2][]]
- _El teatro está en la calle: disímiles estéticas del teatro callejero_ by Osorio [[7][]]
- _Street theatre and other outdoor performance_ by Mason [[6][]]

That being said, I'm noticing that these are a little obscure, and I'm
open to any perspectives that might be more mainstream, more relevant to
the research idea I've laid out, more recent, etc…

This is one post in my long journey to feel out research topics that I
think would be interesting. Maybe you could say that I'm posting them as
an open offer to take this idea and run with it. I'm not really sure
what I plan to do with it, but if this sparked your interest, let me
know. If you have any suggestions of possibly interesting research
topics, please be sure to [contact
