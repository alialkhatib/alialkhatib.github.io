Some things on my mind:

1. portable identity, or reputation, maybe acting as a broker for transient gig--based work
   (still fleshing this out, but will have more to say this week maybe?).
- performance art online (see [my last post][]).
- revising my piecework paper based on some reviews
   (which were, by the way, super constructive and helpful, so
   if you were one of my reviewers, thank you so, so much).
- writing a blog post trying to articulate the idea behind that piecework paper
   for "everyday people". 

I don't really want to publish a blog post about my paper (#4) until
I get confirmation that it's been accepted (best not to tempt fate),
but I can talk about the other stuff, so if you're really curious,
feel free to [contact][] me
