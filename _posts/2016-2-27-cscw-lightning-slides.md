If you were at the CSCW Workshop on
[The Future of Platforms as Sites of Work, Collaboration and Trust][link]
and you're wondering if you can have my slides, take a look
[here][slidesPDF] (pdf).

If you want the LaTeX source code (for some reason...), look
[here][tex] for the .tex file, or
[here][source] for the section of the GitHub repository that should have the whole thing
(you'll want to download the figures or it won't compile)
(and you'll probably want the [mtheme][] beamer theme)
(links might move around, but it's unlikely;
as always, contact me if you can't find something that should be there).
