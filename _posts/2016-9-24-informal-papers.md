title: Informal Papers and Other Stuff

A few weeks ago my mentors from my time at [MSR/FUSE Labs] back in 2015 published a draft of suggestions for anyone interested in designing a peer to peer labor market. You can find [the paper here]. In it, we make a number of suggestions that I think would be important for anyone who wanted to make these markets more worker-centric. You know. Hypothetically.

As part of the awesomeness that is Microsoft Research's ethos, the paper is freely available to download.
In the (highly unlikely) event that this ever changes, please [contact] me and I'll fix it.

I [tweeted] about it, so you may have seen it there. If you think it's interesting, or insightful, or naive, please [contact] me with your thoughts!

In unrelated news, I'm (still) figuring out how to blog about stuff.
I want to blog about things I (ostensibly) know about, but usually I try to reserve all that writing energy for papers,
and then when a paper is done I'd rather just point you readers to that (like with the paper from MSR).
On the other hand, I've seen examples of amazing researchers (like [Danah Boyd]) making their blogs a space where they can publicly ruminate on nascent research ideas - ideas that maybe aren't quite ready for formal scholarship (or, who knows, may never be).
I want to be able to engage with the world like that, but I'm still figuring out how much time these ideas need to "steep" before I can/should share them.
