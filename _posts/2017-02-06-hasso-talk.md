Earlier today I gave a talk to people affiliated with the Hasso Design Thinking program. My talk was short and basically just covered the piecework paper coming up at CHI. You can find the presentation here ([pdf][pdf presentation]) or here ([tex][tex presentation]) --- with the `tex` file you'll probably want the `figures` directory as well (check the [github repo][] if you really want the whole picture).
