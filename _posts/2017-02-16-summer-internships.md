You probably could have guessed that Stanford has 
a program allowing undergraduates to work on research projects over the summer. 
It's called [CURIS][], but 
if you're familiar with "UROP" at other universities, you've got the idea. 
What you may *not* have guessed is that 
Stanford has a program specifically for **non-Stanford applicants**, 
called the [CSLI Summer Internship Program][].


This summer I'm taking a few undergraduates (from Stanford and possibly not) to 
design and build a sort of *résumé for gig workers*. 
You can find more information about the project [here][]. 
Feel free to [contact me][] if you have any questions.
If you're interested, apply by **March 1st**.
