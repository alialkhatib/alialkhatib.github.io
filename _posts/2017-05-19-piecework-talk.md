About a week ago I gave a presentation at CHI ('17) on the paper I wrote on crowd work and gig work and piecework.
I mentioned that you can get the link from my profile on Twitter (via [this link][twitterlink]), but
a blog post is a much nicer way to point to stuff because I can give a few options:

You can have the...

- paper ([pdf][paper]) *~210K*
- source files for the paper ([LaTeX][source file for the paper]) *~228M* (this includes the presentation... poor planning on my part)
- HTML render of the paper ([html][HTML render of the paper]) *~654K* (because that seemed kinda cool)
- talk slide deck ([pdf][talk slide deck]) *~18M*
- source files for the slide deck ([LaTeX][source files for the slide deck]) *~226M* (lots of figures and images that I didn't bother to resize; you can pick and choose what you want)
