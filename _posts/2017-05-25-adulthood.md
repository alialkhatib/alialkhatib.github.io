This isn't exactly timely
(actually, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say this is about as poorly timed as possible),
but I've been thinking a bit about the rotation program Stanford's CS PhD program uses.
For those of you (all ~50 per year) that are considering going to Stanford for your PhD in Computer Science,
this post might be useful.
For the rest of you, maybe you'll just find it interesting in the same way
you might find my passion for waffles, documented on Instagram, interesting.

## What's this "rotation program"?
If you're not familiar, this might be kind of a neat primer.
Basically, Stanford uses this system where first-year PhD students spend one term
(we're on the quarter system, so that's about 10 weeks)
doing a "rotation" with different faculty members.
The idea is that you might do a rotation with
Michael Bernstein, then Jure Leskovec, and finally Dan Jurafsky
and ultimately align with one of them based on your experience working in their lab, being their student, etc...

My sense is that this system was implemented for a few immediate reasons all boiling down to
"making sure you pick the right advisor"
so that you're *less likely*
to encounter friction with your advisor,
to want to change advisors midway, or
to drop out over some disagreement or frustration
that you might have been able to identify within 10 weeks but not within the span of a 30-minute meeting.

My understanding is that this is very much not the norm.
At other universities (in CS) and even at Stanford (in other fields),
it's normal (maybe even **more common**) to apply to the program with a specific principal investigator (PI) in mind.
The problem is that your knowledge of people from other universities is largely informed by the work that they publish,
which has basically nothing to do with the style with which they advise people.
You might find that someone is
extremely acerbic, or
rude, or
too conciliatory and accommodating when you want them to be firm and give you direction.
Any number of factors that could make your PhD experience somewhat miserable are all difficult to determine from the outside
(even if you're clever enough to ask current and former students about their experiences with a professor,
their experiences are highly subjective and individually specific, making it problematic to try and extrapolate to predict your own outcome).

## Okay so why are rotation systems *good*?
So in addition to the inferred purpose that I stated above
(helping you identify your optimal PhD advisor),
there are a few unexpected but totally neat side effects of a rotation program:

### Be (a little) more sure you're aligning with the right person
The above reason can't be overstated; sampling a few potential advisors
makes it much, much more likely that you'll find someone who's a good fit for you.
There's a huge cost associated with switching from one advisor to another in other fields
after several years under your initial advisor
--- you might have read stories of acrimony breeding contempt, and how
that ultimately leads some students to want to change advisors.
And I've heard from students not being able to find another advisor,
leaving them with this unenviable choice of quitting their program or
holding their breath and trying to soldier through for several years.
In theory, the rotation program greatly lessens the probability of that happening.

### No more "what-if"s
By exploring different labs, you're **much** less likely to wonder
"what might have been" if you had aligned with a different advisor.
You know from some thin slice of experience what other labs were like, and
you can at least *kind of* inform that question of "what if" with
the 10 weeks you spent in rotation.
That experience really unshackled me from what would have likely been
a certain amount of dread over whether I was really aligned with the perfect advisor for me
or if I had just found someone who was a sufficiently good fit
(if you're really nerdy and need a CS metaphor, something like "how do I know I'm not in a local maximum?").
Like the CS local maximum/minimum problem,
this solution of randomly hopping around doesn't perfectly solve the problem, but
it gives you good reason to infer that you've actually achieved a global maximum
--- that is, that you've found **the right advisor** rather than **an all right advisor**.
To be clear, this is different from the above point in that
*the confidence you get that you're making the right choice
is something you benefit from even if you align with the professor you expected to align with when you applied to the program*.

### Setting yourself up for your thesis committee
This is sort of tactical, but having spent 10 weeks rotating with
(at least) 2 other faculty members very neatly sets you up for asking them to be on your committee later on.
They know you. You know them. It's great.
It's not a huge deal, but it's nice to have that mostly locked up because of past interaction with them,
shared understandings of one another's strengths and weaknesses, etc...

### Contextualizing and identifying what's "normal" (and what's not)
Even if you're absolutely certain that you'll align with one person (in my case I was),
you can (and should) still take this opportunity to do a bit of a "walkabout"
where you see how other advisors interact with their students, how other labs operate, and what other norms exist.
It gives you some perspective to reference when something weird happens,
like if you don't meet with your advisor regularly,
so you can say something like
"hey, when I rotated with these other professors,
I had one-on-ones with them at least once a week.
I feel like it helped me stay on track. Can we try doing that?"
--- if you have *no* frame of reference, it might not even occur to you that
other professors meet with their students weekly (or several times weekly),
or that research group social events (even low-key things like game or movie nights) are important for group bonding.


## I clicked on the link to hear what's wrong with this system.
**Fair enough.**
There are downsides to the rotation program that I don't think we talk about enough,
so in the interest of being transparent, I can try and unpack some of the criticisms that I've heard and
any that I've experienced.
To be clear, **my experience with rotations was exceptional**, but
I've talked to a number of students who probably wouldn't feel comfortable
having their frustrations and bad experiences publicly associated with them.
Finally, if a university is thinking of adopting a rotation system like Stanford's, or
if a prospective student is thinking about coming to Stanford,
I think (perhaps radically) candid honesty can only help inform your decision.

*I don't care if you come to Stanford;
I care if you regret your choice
(whether to go to Stanford or elsewhere)
because you later felt like you didn't have all the facts.*

### Stress over not having candidates for advisors
Coming to Stanford without knowing for sure who will be your advisor can put you in
this very uncomfortable position of feeling like you're suddenly in competition with other first-year PhD students to be allowed to align with a professor.
It might be (and sometimes is) the case that you'll come to Stanford, find that the person you want to align with is taking 1 student and it's likely someone else
(or even more perplexing, taking *zero* students), and suddenly you're a PhD student without a promising advisor candidate.

**My advice**: Don't come to Stanford
(or go to any university with a rotation system like ours) unless you have one of two things:

- At least `k-1` (where `k` is the number of terms you're expected to take to rotate) professors with whom you can rotate and reasonably hope to secure a spot in their lab.
At Stanford, that's **2**. If you can't identify 2 professors who are planning to take at least 1 student at the end of your first year, then you're taking a huge leap of faith.
- Failing that, a firm, unmistakable, unambiguous commitment from 1 professor that they'll take you into their group.
Then the rotations can just be for fun.

### Stress over juggling competing obligations for the first time
Coming to Stanford *with* 3 faculty in mind who are all happy to align with you can still be a little stressful, because
you're spending this whole first year trying to juggle research and coursework,
trying to impress your rotation advisor within ~10 weeks while also getting As in your breadth-relevant courses, etc...

**My advice**: If it comes down to it, focus on the research rotations at the expense of your courses.
In your PhD program in general (and at Stanford especially),
your coursework is just a checklist that needs to be filled.
They're not more important than your career as a researcher,
which is what you're pursuing as a PhD student.

### Stress over trying to figure this shit out in 10 weeks
This might be more Stanford-specific, but
universities with a rotation program that operate on a quarter system can make you feel like
you're one of containers in a pneumatic tube ---
shooting off at breakneck speeds from one quarter to the next with too little time to get anything done.
Add to that the rumor
(which I'm _pretty sure_ is horse shit) that
something like half of rotations turn into a conference paper
(for readers outside of CS, our "full papers" are typically ~10 pages,
with shorter papers (called "notes") ranging 4-6 pages).

**My advice**: This is a slightly controversial position, so
take it with the grain of salt that I'm a PhD student and not, for instance, a professor
(but also consider the subtly different motivations of PhD students versus professors):
drop any notion of evaluating yourself by the papers you publish
(at *least* for the first year).
Completely reframe your first year criteria according to
whether you got a good sense of how the lab operates, what that professor is like as an advisor, etc...

If you get a paper out of it, cool.
But even if you feel that you accomplished nothing in the publishable sense,
that would be a **negligibly** worse outcome;
what matters for that first year is
coming out the other end feeling very confident that you know what your options are.
