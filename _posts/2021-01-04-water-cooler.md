title: Water Cooler Updates
---

I've been doing open meetings for about 6 months now (I think 50 or 60 meetings total if you're curious).
On balance, it's working really well. I've gotten to chat with some really interesting people doing cool stuff, and most importantly it's been a reliable way to meet new people without it being too stressful.
That being said, I have a few thoughts about what's been working, what hasn't, funny stories, etc...


- 45-minute meetings are still good. They're just slightly too short for conversations that are going great, and slightly too long for conversations that are dragging a bit. I can't anticipate how a chat will go, so this balance works for me. I think this is personal, but 45-minute meetings work for me.
- 15-minute buffers are absolutely crucial. Calendly lets you put buffers before and/or after meetings; I highly recommend at least a 15-minute, maybe 30-minute, buffer after meetings. maybe give yourself a buffer before meetings as well (but in practice I just make a note to get stuff ready 5-10 minutes before the meeting).

Having some extra time to use at my own discretion makes things feel so much more normal. I don't know why, but it does. If the conversation is going really well and we want to keep going, being able to keep talking just feels like the sort of autonomy I had back in the *before-time* when I met with people in physical places and we could get caught up talking in my office or someplace. Being pushed by my calendar into the next meeting just feels disempowering and patronizing.

So there's my manifesto on budgeting some extra time for yourself

- I have meetings from 9am to 7pm local time, with breaks for lunch. Where I am, this barely covers most timezones - in the early morning it's 7:00pm in UTC+5 (India Standard Time is UTC+5:30, which is pretty late, but hopefully not totally unreasonable for someone if they want to chat with me); in the late evening (at 6pm, the last available block) it's 8:00am in UTC+9 (Tokyo & Seoul). That's a little uncomfortably early, but it's hard to make myself much more available without doing two days of open meetings with an early block and a late block, which I'm not prepared to do right now.

If it's super important to you that you make yourself available to people around the world, I think you'd be able to make that happen by doing a morning of meetings and then - on a totally different day, doing an evening of meetings. You'll have to wake up early for the morning block and stay up late on the day with the evening block, but a marathon of meetings is physically difficult.


- I ask people to tell me what's on their mind (to be exact, I ask them "anything on your mind to chat about?") and give them a text box. **I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important this field is.**

The answer to the very simple question "what's on your mind?" has proven to be instrumental in telling me what level the person booking a meeting with me is about. I have used it to cancel a meeting (I'm not going to get into it, except to say that it was someone who was evidently angry and wanted to yell at me over my views on AI and ethics).

Someone will eventually figure out how to appear reasonable in the form and show up to be a monster. For now I've been able to spot those on my own. At some point I might have to figure out something more rigorous, but everything I've thought of has been kinda bad.
