title: Eight Stages of White Settler-Colonial Denial
---

I've been seeing this image floating around and [I mentioned intending to provide alt text][tweet], which led me down a rabbit hole for a little while, including sifting through links that don't work anymore, tweets that don't exist anymore, twitter users who have deleted their accounts, etc... so I wanted to compile information in one place in case more of the web becomes impossible to search and archive effectively... But first, the original image:


![Eight Stages of White Settler-Colonial Denial][eightstages]

... and now, the text (verbatim)

## Eight Stages of White Settler-Colonial Denial

1. **"They didn't exist" (*terra nullius*)**
> 
> Complete denial of Indigenous presence in a given area (country, province, etc). Includes denial of Indigeneity, e.g. "Indigenous Peoples are Settlers too".

2. **"If they did, they weren't here" (*terra nullius*)**
> 
> Denial that Indigenous People inhabit/travel/harvest/exist in a specific area. Often based on euro-centric definitions of evidence of occupation.

3. **"If they were, they didn't use the land" (*doctrine of discovery*)**
> 
> Denial that Indigenous People have a connection with the Land. Often based on euro-centric worldviews of the land as something to be owned and extracted.

4. **"If they did, they didn't deserve it" (*great chain of being*)**
> 
> Denial that Indigenous People have rights to their Lands. Often based on euro-centric value judgements of "primitive vs. civilized", "nomadic vs. sedentary".

5. **"If they did, they lost it" (*right of conquest*)**
> 
> Denial that Indigenous People retain their rights to their Lands. Often based on colonially imposed European systems of law / "might makes right" worldviews.

6. **"If they didn't, it doesn't matter anymore" (*Westphalian sovereignty*)**
> 
> Denial that Indigenous Rights are still binding and take precedence. Often based on false claims of supremacy of colonial legal institutions and systems.

7. **"If it does, we need to move on". (*liberalism*)**
> 
> Denial that violations of Indigenous Rights requires redress. Often based on claims redress is "disruptive/unfair/reverse racism" & false calls for "equality".

8. **"If we can't, we are you" (*self-indigenization*)**
> 
> Denial of separateness of Indigenous Peoples and Rights. Often based on attempts to reduce Indigenous Rights to Human Rights, claim Indigeneity, etc.

### Background

As far as I can tell, it's often attributed to Kim TallBear, who has since deleted her Twitter account, but she fortunately also published [a paper where she pointed out that she didn't create the image and instead saw it on Twitter][KTB_paper]. She apparently saw it posted by someone who went by @pazuzumycete (now deleted), who may have created the graphic or may not have.

... and since I was working with the text a lot, I ended up putting it in a latex file. If you want that text, it's [here][tex]; it produces a PDF much like this:

If you'd like to download a ridiculously high-resolution version (~10k by 13k), you can access it [here][ridic]{:target="_blank"}. I can't imagine why you would want that, but there you go.
