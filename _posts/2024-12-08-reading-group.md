title: "Reading Group?"

---

I've been hinting for a little while on social media like Mona Lisa Vito hinting about her biological clock in *My Cousin Vinny*

but I would be very open to participating in a reading group for certain works. I would be so amenable, in fact, that I might be open to starting one if there's interest.

If anyone would like to read any of the following books, please let me know.

Ideally, @ me with whatever books you would be especially interested in reading. If you have a book in mind that you think is a really close fit within the constellation of the books I suggested, feel free to write in those options. If you're looking for some options, I'm drawing mostly from the list of books on [Workshops 4 Gaza][], so consider browsing that catalog if you're looking.

Additionally, if you have thoughts about what format you'd like to participate in, that might be thought-provoking. Be creative.
