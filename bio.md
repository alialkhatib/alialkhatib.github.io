If you're here, you're looking for a bio. Here are a few options:

> Ali is the interim director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco. His work draws theoretical frameworks from the social sciences to make sense of technical systems and ecologies from the perspectives of people who experience them.

If you need a slightly longer bio, feel free to use this:

> Ali is the interim director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco. His work draws theoretical frameworks from the social sciences to make sense of technical systems and ecologies from the perspectives of people who experience them.
> 
> Ali studied Anthropology and Informatics at UC Irvine, and Computer Science at Stanford University as a PhD student.


And if you need to use a photo, this should work:

<img class="float-left px-2" src="/content/ali_profile_3k_sq_compressed.jpg" srcset="/content/ali_profile_1k_sq_compressed.jpg 1000w, /content/ali_profile_3k_sq_compressed.jpg 3000w" alt="profile photo of Ali Alkhatib">
