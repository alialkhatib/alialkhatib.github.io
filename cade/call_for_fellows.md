## Job Title
Applied Data Ethics Fellow

## Job Summary
The Center for Applied Data Ethics (CADE) at the University of San Francisco is seeking applicants for data ethics fellows. The appointment will be for an appointment beginning January 2022 and tentatively ending January 2023 (end date to be confirmed before offers are made).

This position is open to applicants from a broad range of disciplines and backgrounds. In particular, we are seeking applicants whose experience and training can inform the design and teaching of a deeper curriculum on data ethics and algorithmic justice focusing on methodologies and foundations.

## Full Job Description
Fellows for this incoming program will be responsible for the following goals:

1. Design and teach a course on foundations, methods, or on a specific domain at the undergraduate level;
2. Pursue independent research on the topics to data ethics, algorithmic harms & justice, or related areas; and
3. Disseminate research by sharing work through papers, blog posts, and speaking at conferences (eg industry, non-profit, or academic).

### Responsibilities
#### Teaching
Fellows of this cohort will collectively design a curriculum on data ethics at the University of San Francisco, producing a set of courses spanning multiple terms and addressing a number of general subjects as well as domain areas in greater depth. Potential domain areas include:

- Algorithmic worker management
- Clinical applications of AI
- Algorithmically informed, mediated, or otherwise-enabled policing
- AI (and/or surveillance) in education
- Surveillance in public, private, and/or digital spaces
- Public administration and AI
- Housing, lending, or other financial applications and algorithmic decision systems
- Race and algorithmic harms
- Gender and algorithmic harms

#### Research
Fellows of this cohort will continue to pursue their research agendas or explore new ones, leveraging any resources that CADE, the Data Institute, and the University of San Francisco can make available to the fellows.

### Appointment
This appointment is tentatively expected to run for 1 year, with an extension of 6 months if their course is prepared or already taught. While it is possible that further extensions will be made, that cannot be guaranteed at this time.

### Qualifications
Conventional qualifications - for example, a graduate degree or equivalent experience - serve as a shorthand, but are not strictly necessary. An applicant with a history of advocacy and activism could be successful with a clear and persuasive statement of purpose. We'll work with fellows to understand their professional goals and figure out together how CADE can support those goals. In addition, a deep appreciation for our diverse student population and the ability to foster student success are highly preferred. 

### Submission materials
Applicants should submit the following materials:

- A research agenda proposal, not more than 3 pages, describing the proposed research agenda and substantiating their qualifications to pursue this agenda
- A description, not more than 3 pages, describing the course that the applicant could teach
- A writing sample, not more than 20 pages, where the applicant was either the primary or sole author
- A CV or resume
- 3 potential writers of letters of recommendation (names, relationships, and contact information are sufficient; please be sure that they know the CADE director may be in contact with them directly to request their letter of recommendation)
- A diversity statement expressing your thoughts and/or experiences concerning equitable education for underserved and marginalized communities, your commitment to or experience with broadening participation and accessibility in the field, and/or experience and success in engaging with BIPOC students

Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and interviews will begin as soon as possible, but any applications submitted by **November 20** will be given full consideration. Any questions can be sent to [aalkhatib@usfca.edu](mailto:aalkhatib@usfca.edu).
