I said I'd make a list of conferences that you might want to submit to if you're thinking about AI and ethics, or at least some of the conferences that I think of and sometimes submit to. Here's that list:

- CHI
- CSCW
- FAccT
- DIS
- EAAMO


In my rundown I'm going to briefly describe how favorable reviewing is in these venues, not because some conferences are easier or  harder than others to get into, but because the conferences being really broad (or narrow but misaligned with what your paper is trying to accomplish) can make it really hard for the conference chairs to find reviewers who are really well-suited to evaluate the work you're submitting. If you submit a social theory paper (like the kinds I write) and it goes in front of people who exclusively publish and review papers trying to one-up each other in benchmarks, you're going to have a rough time for reasons that are almost totally unrelated to the quality of your submission.

Larger conferences tend to draw on larger groups of potential reviewers, but there's some variance - you might end up with people who submit and publish at that conference (which is good!) but who travel in such wildly different circles than the one you want to be in that your paper gets misread. Bad times.

With a smaller conference my sense is that it's much clearer from the outset whether you're submitting to the right audience given the kind of paper you're writing. There's a chance the chairs of the conference won't be able to get the "best" reviewers for your papers, but when I review for a small conference I have a very clear mental picture of what this conference is about, and what details are allowed to be a little hand-wavy because that's not the subject focus of the conference.

When you're deciding where to submit a paper, you should think about a few things:

- what papers have been published there in the past?
- who are the organizers (and especially the "area chairs") for the submission track you're thinking about?

If you're thinking of submitting a paper to a conference that the conference has *never* published before, then it's possible that people have tried to submit that kind of paper and all failed. That's not necessarily to discourage you (CSCW has a long history of being difficult for systems-building people to publish in, but they're actively working on fixing that and I hear it's a lot better). It's a *great* sign if you read a bunch of papers at the same conference that feel like they have the same worldview, methods, etc... that your paper works with. I can think of a handful of papers at FAccT that resemble the kinds of papers that I write, and I would be encouraged to submit there; I can't say the same about a conference like CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), even if my paper was *essentially* about computer vision.

The other consideration, *who* are involved in the conference, can be really helpful if the conference is new or if you're trying to branch out from your existing silo. It's generally a good sign if you recognize a lot of the names (better still if you cite them; they might not review your submission but they'll know who understands *their* work well enough to evaluate how well yours leans on their work, if that makes sense). Again, neutral information isn't a bad sign, but if I saw the names of people whose work I find rather objectionable or totally misaligned from my work, I would think about whether they even know who to even ask to review my submission.

I always, always encourage people to do some basic research on the venue that you're thinking about submitting to. What do the papers from the last year or two look like (or at least the ones with keywords close to your paper)? What kind of stuff do the organizers write and publish about? These signals can tell you a lot more than the main page or the "About this conference" page can possibly say. Listen to what people and organizations *do* - if they say they want to publish the kind of work you're thinking about, but you can't find any evidence of commitment to that, it might be really risky to submit there.

### CHI (Human-Computer Interaction)
I mostly (almost exclusively?) submit here. It's a fairly large conference that broadly thinks about human-computer interaction, with a lean toward design implications and designing systems in general. It can be hard to submit a paper to this conference if design is not ultimately the goal of your paper, but it's absolutely not impossible, and if you can get a paper in here, it'll be in front of lots of people from lots of different areas (whereas some of the other conferences below may be a bit more niche - which has its pros and cons).

CHI can be a difficult place to submit because there are thousands of submissions and the struggle to find reviewers who are well-aligned to the kind of work you're doing is like searching for a needle in a haystack. If you're submitting a theory paper, getting your paper reviewed by someone who does user interface evaluations will give you a different perspective on your draft, but they might pick at issues with your paper that aren't meant to be structural support beams. This kinda thing happens to me somewhat often, and the advice we give reviewers to "review the submission in front of you, not the idealized version of what *you* would have done if you were writing this paper" gets repeated a lot.

### CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work)
This might be the conference I "consume" from the most often; broadly interested in any kind of relationships between computational systems and people, whether those people are perceived as users or not (eg people who are acted upon by systems). My perception of this conference is that there's more qualitative work (compared to CHI or FAccT), but there's plenty of both.

I think the smaller size of the conference makes it clearer whether you should submit here at all compared to CHI - I'd describe CSCW's interest as a subset of CHI's - which can make finding suitable reviewers easier.

### FAccT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning)
I find myself reviewing for this conference pretty often, so I guess I'm at least adjacent to it. I feel like there's a lot of papers here that try to map out what an actual designed system can do to offset and mitigate algorithmic bias, although the language is increasingly moving toward describing this as minimizing "harms". The distinction I'm trying to draw with that (or that I think the discourse is trying to point to) is that algorithmic bias could be any number of things, including a misrepresentation of historic prejudices; accounting for and minimizing those may simply perpetuate harms.

Anyway, I was saying this is much more focused on AI and Machine Learning. This conference has an odd mix of very steeply quantitative stuff with proofs and modeling and stuff, and then very steeply qualitative stuff that goes really deep on social theory. For that reason alone I would be careful about submitting here out of fear that my submission would land in front of a couple of reviewers who are totally mismatched for your submission, but I think I've only been asked to review a total mismatch of a paper once or twice, which is a pretty good track record, all things considered.

### DIS (Designing Interactive Systems)
I actually don't have any experience submitting here, but it's a conference I've reviewed for and I've seen lots of good papers come out of DIS, so it's a credible option that you should check out and consider.

### EAAMO (Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization)
This conference is just getting started, but it seems to have all the right key words, lists a lot of the right people, etc... to suggest to me that this is the sort of place I would submit to, review for, and attend when the appropriate dates come up.
