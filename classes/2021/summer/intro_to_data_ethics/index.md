# Intro to Data Ethics
- When: Fridays, 10am-12pm, May 28 - July 2
- Where: Zoom*
- Instructor: Ali Alkhatib


## Focus
Teaching "data ethics" is kind of Sisyphean - no matter how much work you think you've done to close the gap, new stuff always seems to emerge that forces you to start gaining domain expertise in some new area. There are too many shifting, moving, and changing pieces; and axioms and concrete rules to follow will either be too ossified to be relevant in 6 months or too nebulous to be actionable right now.

I don't see any point in teaching you a bunch of concrete rules to follow; instead, I think you'll be much better-equipped if you come away from this class knowing how to find ways to work through issues that arises, which means not just taking you to the destination, but giving you the engine you need to get there (and anywhere else you need to go) on your own.

That might sound like I'm trying to be "neutral" or objective - I'm not. I think that turning our attention back on ourselves, on our field, and on the experiences of people affected by systems we build is an *explicit* choice we make (or don't make), and it would be disingenuous (and maybe kind of silly) to say that we're interested in ethics but also that we're neutral. In the first class I'll probably go on a rant about how "neutrality" isn't an idea that parses out in the context of ethics, but I'll save that for the zoom.

## Topics for this course:
If you thought about taking the data ethics course with Dr. Thomas last year, you might recognize a few of the modules. In general I'm following her class structure, but I moved a few things around and replaced a few things based on stuff that's happened in the past year (a *few* things have happened).

## Communication

### Slack
The Data Institute has a Slack! I want you to use that to ask questions, comment on the readings, and post interesting news stories.
I'll follow up after the first class to invite people into the slack org (if needed) and into the slack channel once I've made it.

### "Office hours"
I'll hold ad hoc meetings during "office hours", but I know you're all zooming in from all over the world, and some of you have jobs or childcare or just things you need to attend to, so don't feel obligated to make my office hours if you've got something that interferes with that.

#### Ad hoc meetings
I'll be available on Mondays from 10pm to 2pm pacific time, and by appointment.

If it's within that time window, I *should* be active and on Slack, with the expectation that I can get on zoom to do a video or audio call if you want. Just let me know what medium you prefer.

#### Scheduled meetings
First off, please feel free to [contact me][contact] at any point if you'd like to set up a time to chat.

I also run a thing where you can book a meeting time that works for you. That might be easier for you. Feel free to book a meeting [here][meet]. I think I usually keep Tuesdays and Wednesdays clear? But that doesn't mean I'm busy on other days or at other times. Ask if you can't find a good time.


## Outcomes
Here's what I want you to develop or pick up in this course:

- an understanding of the historically and culturally-situated nature of data itself
- tools you'll need to explore murky questions and stubborn issues
- a motivated sense of what you should be striving for, given the difficult issues here
- a sense of differential impacts of data collection and use on vulnerable people
- a clear expository sense of data science's history, and a persuasive vision of its future
- how to make those future steps possible, and how to bring them into existence


## Deliverables
Here's what I'll want you to do that I'll be able to see.

Every week I want you to read the required readings. During zooms I would *really* like for people to chime in with questions, thoughts, provocations, whatever comes to mind.

That being said, I realize that's asking a lot, and I know some people have never thrived under that paradigm (let alone when that was held in zoom).

I'll evaluate your work in two ways, for different things. At a high level, they are:

- **Reflections**: weekly, due on Wednesdays at 11:59pm AOE (anywhere on earth)
- **Term paper**: 5 pages, due on the final day of class

### Reflections

tl;dr: Every week, you'll write short reflections on the readings that we'll discuss later that week. Submit those by **Wednesday 11:59pm AOE** (anywhere on earth).

For these reflections, I'm only interested in two things:

1. did you read the articles? and
2. what ideas seemed to resonate or frustrate people in the class?

I want to be really clear about something: I don't care how long these are, except that they should **not** be longer than half a page. I'd be satisfied by a bullet point list of half-formed thoughts. Give me 3 or 4 distinct ideas.

**These should amount to more than summaries of the articles.**

If you're desperate for a template, list out or write about 2 or 3 of the following:

- 1 or 2 parts of the article that surprised you
- 1 or 2 parts of the article that you had trouble agreeing with
- 1 or 2 questions that remain unanswered for you
- 1 or 2 connections to some of the reading from a previous week

That'd be *plenty*. And depending on how you do it, you'll be laying the groundwork for your term paper.


### Term paper

tl;dr: you'll write a **5-page position paper** calling attention to a topic and advocating some change in policy or design, **due at 11:59pm AOE on the last day of class**

I want you to be able to identify and describe an issue, situate it, and ultimately make a persuasive argument that we (where "we" is up to you) should do something different.

I'll detail what I'm expecting in more precise terms soon, but I want to be intentionally open-ended since I trust your judgment.

<!-- #### identifying and describing an issue
The issue doesn't have to be a topic we discussed in class. Honestly, you might be better off going further afield and finding something we don't cover in-depth - if I've read 10 papers about the merits of digital contact tracing, what are the odds that the 11th paper on digital contact tracing will introduce some a perspective I haven't seen half a dozen times?

All that is to say *if you're earnestly personally motivated to write about it, then yes, write about anything you want; but if you're just looking for any old topic, all else being equal, you'd be better off picking a topic that we haven't talked about ad nauseam*.

#### situating a topic
One of the goals of this class is to get you to recognize the social and historical influences that bear on topics in AI and data science. This is where you'll do that. This will also hopefully give you a lot of context that informs the argument you ultimately make.

## (Tentative) Schedule
If something substantial happens in the world, I might revise the syllabus, but I'll try to give at least a week's worth of advance notice. Don't read too far ahead - or if you do, be prepared for the possibility that things will shift (or get introduced), especially further out ahead.
