# Intro to Data Ethics
- When: Tuesdays, 6-8pm, March 23-April 27
- Where: Zoom*
- Instructor: Ali Alkhatib


## Focus
Teaching "data ethics" is kind of a hopeless task - there are too many developments; there are too many shifting, moving, and changing pieces; and axioms and concrete rules to follow will either be too ossified to be relevant in 6 months or too nebulous to be actionable right now.

Fiesler et al. wrote in 2019 that there's a substantial amount of variability in ethics courses across the US and world, and made the argument that this isn't necessarily a bad thing - that it reflects different intellectual backgrounds and epistemological worldviews (Fiesler et al 2019).

This class takes that idea and goes a bit further with it. That is to say, we're going to point out a few of the different lenses that exist in data ethics, how those lenses on problems bring people and things into and out of focus.
If you've ever studied anthropology, I hope that you'll recognize some of the ethos here.
I don't see any point in teaching you a bunch of concrete rules to follow; instead, I think you'll be much better-equipped if you come away from this class knowing how to seek the answers to any kind of question that arises, which means not just taking you to the destination, but giving you the engine you need to get there (and anywhere else you need to go) on your own.

That might sound like I'm trying to be "neutral" or objective - I'm not. I think that turning our attention back on ourselves, on our field, and on the experiences of people affected by systems we build is an *explicit* choice we make (or don't make), and it would be disingenuous (and maybe kind of silly) to say that we're interested in ethics but also that we're neutral. In the first class I'll probably go on a rant about how "neutrality" isn't an idea that parses out in the context of ethics, but I'll save that for the zoom.


## Topics for this course:
If you thought about taking the data ethics course with Dr. Thomas last year, you might recognize a few of the modules. In general I'm following her class structure, but I moved a few things around and replaced a few things based on stuff that's happened in the past year (a *few* things have happened).

## Communication:
I've made a Discord for the class where I'll occasionally drop interesting links and articles. For major announcements, I'll post in Discord and then email the roster of current students. There'll be more about my expectations for Discord below.

## "Office hours"
I want to try to be available for people to ask questions or just to chat. In general, I'll try to be on Discord most of the time (in part because I don't want to leave the chat unmoderated). That being said, I'm going to commit to be on Discord for the following time windows:

- Mondays:     2 pm -  4 pm (PDT)
- Wednesdays: 12 pm -  2 pm (PDT)
- Thursdays:  10 am - 12 pm (PDT)

I'm trying to stagger the times, the idea being that since some of you are not on the west coast (or in any US timezones, for that matter), I want to be available during a window of time that's somewhat reasonable for you.

If any of these times don't work, please feel free to let me know and we can figure out another time.


## Outcomes
Here's what I want you to develop or pick up in this course:

- an understanding of the historically and culturally-situated nature of data itself
- tools you'll need to explore murky questions and stubborn issues
- a motivated sense of what you should be striving for, given the difficult issues here
- a sense of differential impacts of data collection and use on vulnerable people
- a clear expository sense of data science's history, and a persuasive vision of its future
- how to make those future steps possible, and how to bring them into existence



## Deliverables
Here's what I'll want you to do that I'll be able to see.

Every week I want you to read the required readings. During zooms I would *really* like for people to chime in with questions, thoughts, provocations, whatever comes to mind.
That being said, I realize that's asking a lot, and I know some people have never thrived under that paradigm (let alone when that was held in zoom).

What we've arrived at in the first class discussion is the following:

- I need everyone to chat in the Discord about the readings. I expect at least one or two substantive comments in the Discord from everyone per week.
- I want people to drop interesting news stories and developments in AI and data ethics that we might want to discuss in the next class. This isn't required, but it would be really great to know what you all are hearing about and thinking about.
- In the first class, someone suggested hanging out socially; I would love if you all did that - feel free to use the Discord as long as everyone is respectful and inclusive in activities. Viewing parties, reading groups, etc... would all be great. But don't feel obligated; I just want you to feel welcome to use the space for those purposes if you want.




## Reading Syllabus

We discussed the syllabus and topics of interest in the first class, and I'm considering how to incorporate some of the thoughts and goals that you all mentioned in that class. That being said, here's the tentative syllabus.

### Week 1: About the Histories of Data
In the data ethics space we talk a lot about bias in datasets that lead to the harm of marginalized communities.
This week I want us to think about where data come from, and motivate a sense that every decision we make about data - from the structure of that data to how and what we count - betrays our biases.
