## Direct
You can [email me][email] if you'd like.

If you'd like to reach me via Signal, please reach out by email for contact information and I'll send you my contact info.


## Social
You might find me on [twitter][tw], but I'm generally not directing much energy or attention there anymore.

*If you want to follow an online presence, I recommend *mastodon*.*

I'm on [mastodon][masto], where you can follow me. my handle is <span id="masto">`ali@masto.al2.in`</span> <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary citations btn-block" data-clipboard-target="#masto">
  copy masto handle
</button>


I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, and other sites. 
Don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never find them.

window.onload=function(){
  var btns = document.querySelectorAll("button");
  var clipboard = new Clipboard(btns);
