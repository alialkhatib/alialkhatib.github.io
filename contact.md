You can [email][email] me if you'd like. 
I'm always swamped, so short emails get replies sooner.

I'm also on [twitter][tw] & [facebook][fb].

I have a strong aversion to adding people on Facebook until I've met them in person.

I'm only saying that to make it less awkward if I don't accept your friend request.

I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, and half a dozen other sites. 
Don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never see them.

If you'd like to contact me by Google Hangouts or Skype, my accounts for both are

ali`[at]`ali-alkhatib.com

*Please* email, tweet, or somehow contact me to let me know if you plan on contacting me this way. I'm rarely logged in to Skype or (that particular) Google account, so it'll seem like I'm never online unless I know someone's waiting for me.
