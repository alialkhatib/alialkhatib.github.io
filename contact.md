This page is divided into two sections. The first section is "ways you can reach out". The second section is more of a ledger of other places I am so you don't necessarily get duped into following someone impersonating me on that platform. Please don't think of the second section as an alternative mode to reach out to me; think of it as some level of proof that I do in fact use that platform you're thinking of, and that profile page is in fact me. If I ever make a backup page or anything of that nature, I'll post those here too.
