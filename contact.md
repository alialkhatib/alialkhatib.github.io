You can [email me][email] if you'd like. I'm also on [twitter][tw], where my DMs are open.

I'm [trying a thing][] where I make myself available for 30- & 45-minute blocks of time throughout the week.
If you'd like to schedule a video chat, feel free to [claim a block][].

I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, and other sites. 
Don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never find them.
