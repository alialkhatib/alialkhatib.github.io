<!-- This page kinda got out of hand. -->
You can reach me a number of ways.

## Direct


You can [**email** me][email] if you'd like.

If you'd like to reach me via **Signal**, please reach out by email for contact information and I'll send you my contact info.

If you'd like to set up a meeting, feel free to book a meeting [here][meet]

## Social

<!-- Mostly I'm on **Twitter** and **Mastodon**, although I'm sure I'm forgetting something. -->

I use [**Twitter**][tw] less often than I used to, but that option is there if you'd like to follow me there.

I'm arguably more active, and more engaged, on [**mastodon**][masto], where you can also follow me. My handle is:

<span id="masto">`ali@masto.al2.in`</span>
<button class="btn btn-mini" data-clipboard-target="#masto"><i class="fa-regular fa-copy"></i>
</button>


---

## Do not
I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, Cohost, TikTok, Instagram, and a number of other places where you can theoretically message me.

**Don't do that.**

Please try not to reach out to me on platforms I didn't offer on this page. I probably won't find your message, and if I do find it I probably won't like it.
