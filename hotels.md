# Hotels

I tried to select a sample of photos that gives a good impression of what the place offers, as well as provide some basic information about the place like how many people could stay there, how long it would take to get to the conference on foot, and anything else that came up in the reviews that might be relevant. If you want information along a certain dimension, or if you want me to look at more places (e.g. places with fewer than four bedrooms, or further away than the ones I have), message me on slack.


## [Best Boutique Hotel in Montreal][bbhm]

![example](https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6f98d62b-e3e5-49ff-ac3e-a50d724175d5.jpg?aki_policy=x_large)

### basic details
- 7 bedrooms
- 5 bathrooms
- about 20 minutes (walking) to the conference (this is a very rough estimate)
- the layout seems to be confederated; there are multiple kitchens and rooms - it really looks more like a handful of smaller apartments than a single large place with a shared space for everyone
- 7 bedrooms (every room has 1 bed and some sofa beds and air mattresses; if you want to bring more people into your room, please let me know so we can make sure we're not overbooking or making things uncomfortable for the rest of us)

### basic details
- 5 bedrooms
- 2 bathrooms
- some shared bedrooms, making it possible to accommodate up to 8 people with "real" beds (as opposed to sofa beds or air mattresses), but again 5 private bedrooms, so we're going with that capacity
- 20 minutes walking, 15 minutes by public transit
- the interior seems to be pretty run down according to reviews from as recently as December. exposed wires, small bathrooms, etc...
- close to bars
- some spotty reviews. it seems like we'd be making some compromises to pick this place

### basic details
- 8 bedrooms (by all appearances they're real bedrooms with privacy and everything); can support up to 11 people based purely on permanent beds
- 30 minutes walking, 15 minutes by public transit
- 3 bathrooms
- washer/dryer
- very few reviews (this proved to be a problem last year)
