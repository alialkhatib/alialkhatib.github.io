I think and write about power and technology. You can see some of my work on the [research][] page, or see what I'm thinking about more currently on my [blog][].



I was interim Director for the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco. Before that,
I studied Computer Science at Stanford while pursuing a PhD, where I worked with [Michael Bernstein][msb].


I earned a BA in Anthropology & a BS in Informatics,
specializing in human-computer interaction,
both from UC Irvine in 2014.
I wrote an honors thesis on the culture of [Quantified Self][qsthesis]
while I worked with [Tom Boellstorff][boellstorff].
