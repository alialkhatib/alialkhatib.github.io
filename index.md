Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University,
specifically studying Human-Computer Interaction.
My advisor is [Michael Bernstein][msb].

I'll be at [Platform Cooperativism][PC] in mid-November; if you're interested in that general topic, I'd be happy to chat with you about it sometime (see my [contact][] page).

This past Summer I was in Seattle,
interning with Microsoft Research's [FUSE labs][fuselabs].
Check my [blog][blog] for more info
(Also, [this post][fuseblogpost] on the FUSE labs blog is a good overview of what I was working on).

I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics,
specializing in Human-Computer Interaction,
both from UC Irvine in 2014.
My honors thesis was on the culture of [Quantified Self][qsthesis],
and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff][boellstorff].

I *try* to reply to all emails that are actually sent to me (but not mass mailers);
that being said, if you want to be sure to get my attention I'm pretty sure a book off my [wishlist][wishlist] would do the trick.

If this isn't enough info, click on some links floating around this text in various places
(determined mostly by the size of your window).
