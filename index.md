Hi, that's me.

**Fair warning: I'm at CSCW in San Francisco this week (February 27 through March 2).**

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University,
specifically studying Human-Computer Interaction.
My advisor is [Michael Bernstein][msb].

I'm working on cooperative labor markets.
Check my [blog][blog] for more info
(Also, [this post][fuseblogpost] on the FUSE labs blog is a good overview of what I was working on).

I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics,
specializing in Human-Computer Interaction,
both from UC Irvine in 2014.
My honors thesis was on the culture of [Quantified Self][qsthesis],
and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff][boellstorff].
