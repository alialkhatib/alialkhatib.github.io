Hi. If you're on this page, it may be because you're looking to interview me. If you're interviewing me because you're writing something about *me* or about *something I wrote*, then by all means feel free to [contact me][]. I can't think of many better people than me to talk about my life and my work.

If, however, you're interviewing me for something more generally about AI bias and harms, or about gig work or crowd work, then read on.

While I appreciate that you're reaching out to me, there's a really bad trend going around these days where people in my area of work will get ignored outright - or (perhaps worse) interviewed and then edited out of the final version of the piece or the video that goes online.

I say "people"; I'm specifically talking about people of color, women, and non-binary people. And this is particularly worrying for a few reasons:

1. Many of these people are the pioneers of this field
2. There's a history of erasing Black women's work that's taking place, and this trend continues that history
3. Erasure like this severely damages the careers of people of color, women, and non-binary folks (especially but not only) in academia who need citations and press to make a successful case for tenure

I'll be happy to do an interview ([contact me][]), but I want to offer a few suggestions of people you might want to talk to in addition to me, or even *instead* of me if you have a time constraint or you won't be able to center and cite the work of multiple people. I'll be happy to make introductions if you need an introduction and if I know the person well enough for that.

I don't want you to feel like you need to talk to (or attempt to talk to) all of these people before talking to me. But if you haven't considered interviewing *anyone* from a historically marginalized group (let alone tried to reach out to them), then I might turn down your request, or at least redirect you to one of these people. So it'll be faster if you try one of them without me bouncing your email.

Okay, this list is in no particular order. It's also not comprehensive; I'll add names of people as I remember or encounter their work.

If you know of someone I should've mentioned, please feel free to @ me on twitter or something.

I'm reluctant to give summaries of what these people do because there's no way I could satisfactorily summarize each of these people's work unless I did a really shitty job glossing over a lot of their work, but if this list proves to be useless without some contextual clues about why you would reach out to one person vs another, then I might add something describing extremely briefly how their work might have intersected with mine in a way that would make them a more authoritative source than me in that subject.
