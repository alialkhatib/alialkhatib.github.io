Right now I'm (still?) working on cooperative labor markets and trying to figure out how to make the "collective governance" challenge work.
Or more directly, I'm trying to figure out how to make it work in a way that's exportable.

I'm also working on some coded stuff on the side - mostly a duplication of API endpoints exposed by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).
The idea here is to create a drop-in replacement for most requesters of AMT, and make that codebase runnable by Turkers so that they can collectively decide their rules and whatnot (and maybe, if they want, fork it and go in their own direction).

So in a sense, I'm attacking this cooperative labor market problem with two prongs:
the social (collective governance), and the technical (building the system).

No publications are in the "pipeline".
I've got a few ideas on my plate currently, some loosely connected:

- ethnographic fieldwork of workers, with the evaluation resulting in the cooperative, participatory design of a mobile application (sort of a work in progress)
- contextualizing the gig economy in piecework (the longer-running theme of speculative work nominally beginning in the 19th century)
- thinking about the blockchain and the shortcomings it systematizes

I *might* be blogging about this (see [blog][]), but if you're interested I really recommend [contact][]ing me.
