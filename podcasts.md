I'm doing this on my phone so bear with me

# Podcast recs

- Conan O'Brien needs a friend

Conan talks to comedians and they joke about how awkward he is and stuff. V relatable for me

- dreamgun film reads

These British comedians do a funny reading of a famous movie like the matrix or Shawshank redemption or toy story

- even more news

Normally won't recommend news stuff but I really like the hosts and they're comedians so they bring humor to it

- BBC The forum

It's like a panel of experts on the topic of the episode, usually a person in history

- no such thing as a fish

It's a british podcast (again lol) where 3 or 4 people talk about the most interesting facts they've learned over the last week (their job is to do that for a tv show called QI, so they find good ones)

- somehow I manage

There are LOTS of good podcasts about tv shows, and even several about the office (and even one hosted by two of the major characters), but I like this more lol

- trailblazers (with Ryan Broderick)

I need to figure out how to share this feed but it's Ryan Broderick and other people talking about the internet memes that have emerged over the past week. It's... amazing
