Hey! Not sure what's going on with Twitter, but for now I'm assuming it's unreliable.

I'll be using [Netflix Sync Party](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-sync-party/iglgjeoppncgpbbaildpifdnncgbpofl) because it's *just* a playback synchronizer. There's no chat, so you don't need to join if you don't want to. I don't like the chat option that Teleparty offers.

I might also make a chat space. I was planning on letting people just chat by text over twitter, but since it's clearly not working... lol. ~~Maybe it'll be a discord.~~

Hey there's a discord if you want to join! You should be able to join it [here](https://discord.gg/36ugJ6)

~~Check back here about 30 minutes before the viewing party is set to begin (nominally at 8pm EST); there should be links to sync up playback and other information.~~

If you want to join and *just* enjoy the show, [this link](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70158330?syncGMTTimestampSec=1602807248.5410001) (with the chrome extension before) should get you set up. We'll start at ~8:15pm EST (the link should give you a countdown)

Sorry for the technical difficulties!

Oh, and if you want, maybe email trek@al2.in for updates? I dunno. Or just check here later lol.
